<p>Import allows a new file to be created from a user supplied CSV file
which represents the exact content of the new file on a record by record
and field by field basis. The input CSV contains one for each data
record, with each record field then listed within each row. For example,
</p>
<p>The leading records on an X9 file would appear as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<p>Import requires that you provide the exact values for each field
within each record. Import takes your field values and applies
construction rules to ensure that individual fields are populated within
each record appropriately. For example, if a field is required as
numeric zero filled, then the value will be padded with zeroes on the
left as required by the data specification. Another example is
justification, where fields are required to be justified left or right
and then blank filled. The Import process performs the appropriate
justification and padding per all field specifications. </p>
<p>Although you must provide every record in every field, you do not
need to provide the accumulated values for the summary counts and
amounts in the various trailer records. A value of zero can be supplied
instead as proxy for those various fields, and then indicate that
auto-repair of the trailer records should be run as part of the import
process. When you set the trailer counts and amounts to zero, you must
then select the trailer repair option on the import panel. Note that
this repair will not run all available repair actions, but will ONLY
repair the summary accounts and amounts in the various file trailer
records. </p>
<p>Importing a Previously Exported File</p>
<p>Import can be used to create a new file from a file that was
previously exported, since they share the same CSV format. This is a
very common and logical approach to create a new file when you need to
apply complex or repetitive data modifications. In this scenario, you
can export a file, modify the created CSV file using various data
manipulation tools, and then import the resulting CSV file to create a
new and modified result. </p>
<p>CSV Format</p>
<p>Some tools that create CSV files will include column definitions as
header rows on the front of the created file. If you have such a file
and cannot easily remove those header lines, import will allow you to
provide the number of lines to be skipped. Remember that the first line
being imported must always be a file header record. </p>
<p>CSV files will typically have all fields enclosed in single or double
quotes, with fields separated by either commas or tab characters. Import
supports these various formats and will automatically identify and
accept those characters appropriately when present. </p>
<p>Check Images</p>
<p>The x9 output file created by the Import will always contain images.
Images can either be imported from external files, or they can be
dynamically inserted by X9Assist. If you provide the images, then a
separate tiff file must exist for each front image and back image. </p>
<p>There are several available options. You can directly provide the
actual images that you want to include in the x9 file. A separate front
image and back image must be provided for each check. Your images will
be included and inserted into the x9 file being generated. The import
operation will be aborted if your image cannot be found, or if it is
determined that the image you have provided is not a valid tiff format
and hence is not usable. </p>
<p>You can alternatively insert replacement images for each front and
back image using one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert missing image documents: missing image documents will be
inserted. These images can be customized with your specific missing
image design. </li>
<li>Insert missing image documents that include MICR lines: missing
image documents will be inserted, where the front image will contain
MICR lines that are constructed from the x9 data. </li>
<li>Dynamically draw the images from the imported x9 data: images will
be redrawn using the information that is being assigned to the type 25
or type 31 check detail record. X9Assist will ensure that the image
meets tiff standards. You can select the check format (artwork) on the
image templates tab. You can also provide additional customization using
the “draft check” tab within program options. </li>
</ul>
<p>Record Type 52</p>
<p>The x9 check image record is record type 52 (image view data record).
</p>
<p>Field 52.18 (check image length): your value for this field is
ignored; Import will assign this length automatically from the image
itself. </p>
<p>Field 52.19 (check image): there are several options for this
field:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>The images can be located within a single folder. In that case, the
image file name can be unqualified, and you can instead select the
folder which contains the images. Each check will have two images (front
and back) and hence they must be uniquely named. </li>
<li>Images can instead be located in multiple folders. In this case, you
would not select an import folder, but would instead provide a fully
qualified image file name for each check image. </li>
<li>You should use a file naming scheme that defines the check number
and the logical image side. An example would be to name your image files
“Check_nnnnn_sssss.tif”, where nnnnn is the check number or record
number within the overall x9 file; sssss is either “front” or “back”.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Import Data Example</p>
<p>This import example is included in the examples folder and includes
the check images. You can actually import the file and examine the
results. </p>
