<p>The task of creating both x9 and ach test files can become a very
complex task. There are multiple issues and challenging problems that
must be solved to allow the creation of these files. One must: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define a tool to allow your test cases to be defined (either
centrally or on a distributed basis), reviewed, corrected, maintained,
reported against, and distributed as required. </li>
<li>Construct your items (debits and credits). </li>
<li>Create and populate addenda (endorsement) records to accompany your
transactions. </li>
<li>Wrap the resulting transactions into bundles, a cash letter (for
x9), and an overall file with the appropriate records, control totals,
and file structure. </li>
<li>Build the data file with field values assigned based on length,
justification, and pad characters into the target record types and
formats subject to the rules specification.</li>
<li>For x9, also create industry conforming TIFF images that match the
generated items so CAR/LAR can be run against the resulting file. </li>
</ol>
<p>X9Assist is your tool to address these data generation requirements.
The following tools are used to perform each of the above tasks: </p>

<p>Make has been designed to simplify the creation of your test files.
When paired with Generate, you can easily create test files from simple
input files which can either XLS, XLSX, XLSM, or CSV. Make and Generate
assume all of the tasks needed to format the data fields, construct the
record types, and insert the needed headers and trailers with the
appropriate control totals. </p>
<p>A Make run will always invoke our make, generate, and import
processes. However, although these tools can be used individually, Make
has been designed and implemented in a manner that allows your to view
this as a single tool. This allows it to run in a single step, with the
goal of reducing complexity and increasing productivity. Make can
satisfy test document requirements for even the most complex testing
needs based on the continuing enhancements that have been made.</p>
<p>For x9 files, Make/Generate can create output tiff images using
either the E13B or CMC7 fonts to construct and draw the associated
encoded MICR lines within the MICR band area. </p>
<p>Just to review: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make</strong> is used to create items (debits and credits)
from your use case definitions. </li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong> is used to create various additional
record types (addenda, image records, credit records, headers, and
trailers) as needed to ultimately build a valid file structure.</li>
<li><strong>Import (for X9) </strong>is used to build the final output
file by forming each data record per the requested file specification,
assigning field attributes (lengths, justification, padding, etc) and
ultimately writing the output file as both fixed and variable length
records. This final step is not used for ach, since the file format is
much simpler in nature. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can view Make as a single tool that performs all of these
functions. It is also interesting that each of these tools can be used
independently for their respective functions. In this manner, X9Assist
is designed to provide the appropriate tool to meet your needs. </p>
<p>Make/Generate as a Single Step Process</p>
<p>Although Generate can be run as a stand alone process, it is more
typically run within a fully integrated Make/Generate function where
they are run together as a single step. The Make panel allows you to
first load your reformatter (which defines your Make parameters) and
your generator (which defines your Generate parameters). When you run
Make, you will see the Generate tabs are appended to the bottom of the
Make tabs (on the right). The combined list of tabs provides all
functionality to run Make and Generate within a single step operation.
</p>
<p>Using Excel To Maintain your Use Cases</p>
<p>Why reinvent the wheel? MS-Excel is very commonly used within the
industry. X9Assist takes advantages of your Excel knowledge by allow you
to create, edit, and save your use case files directly as an Excel
workbook. Make will read these workbooks directly without the need to
convert them to some other format such as CSV. X9Assist supports both
the XLS (Excel 97-2003) and XLSX and XLSM (Excel 2007) workbook formats.
</p>
<p>Columns identifiers can be entered either as numeric values (eg, 1,
2, 3, 4…) or as Excel identifiers (eg, A, B, C, D ….). When you enter
column identifiers in Excel format, they will be converted and stored as
their corresponding numerical value. </p>
<p>Using Excel Custom Number Formats</p>
<p>A number format is a special code to control how a value is displayed
within Excel. Custom number formats can be used to control the display
of numbers, dates, times, fractions, percentages, and other numeric
values. Through the use of custom formats, you can do things like format
dates to show month names only, format large numbers in millions or
thousands, and display negative numbers in red.</p>
<p>You can optionally format your amount columns as numeric using
decimals. If you provide a numeric field via a formula, it is important
that you format that column as containing numeric data (and not general
or text data). You can set the number of decimal places based on your
formatting requirements (typically zero or two). If you use a format
string against a numeric field, then Make will remove any commas,
periods, or dollar signs that are present within the resulting string.
</p>
<p>Generally, routing numbers are entered into your use case files as 9
digit numbers. However, there are times when it is desirable to
explicitly format routings as either xxxx-xxxx (older US eight digit
format) or xxxxx-xxx (Canadian format). X9Assist refers to these formats
as 4x4 and 5x3, respectively. In these situations, it is recommended
that these cells be formatted as text and not as numeric data with a
custom formatting pattern. Using Excel text allows data to be entered on
a WYSIWYG basis (what you see is what you get). By using this approach,
you can define routing numbers in any desirable format as needed for
negative use case testing (for example, 3x5 or 6x2). However, if there
is a specific need to define routing numbers as numeric with a
formatting pattern, then the following may be used:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Routing Format</td>
<td>Usage</td>
<td>Format 1</td>
<td>Format 2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4x4</td>
<td>US routing format</td>
<td>0000-0000</td>
<td>####-####</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5x3</td>
<td>Canadian routing format</td>
<td>00000-000</td>
<td>#####-###</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Other than the above stated exceptions, we do not recommend the use
of custom number formats within your Excel use case definitions. Our
alternative recommendation is that columns should be formatted as “Text”
which means that the content will be treated as text even when a number
is entered, and that the cell will be displayed and passed to Make
exactly as it is entered. Using this best practice allows your fields to
be processed on a WYSIWYG basis (what you see is what you get). Although
Make supports the translation of numeric fields to strings through the
use of Excel custom format strings, we do not recommend this only due to
the complexities that are added to the process. </p>
<p>Using Excel Formulas</p>
<p>You can use formulas within your Excel worksheets to calculate values
and feed those into Make. For example, you can use a formula to add up a
list of items and provide that total into Make (also note that a deposit
amount can be provided as zero, and Make will automatically calculate
the tote for you). Another example of using a formula would be to
inspect your ABA and transaction code combination, to assign the check
format that you want to use for every item. Or you can define a formula
to assign the memo field with your use case number. There are many
potential uses formulas, allowing you to provide automation to your Make
process. </p>
<p>Running Make</p>
<p>Make operates with several input components that must be selected:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A reformatter which defines the rules on how to transform your use
case file into the actual data that is needed by Generate. A high level
description of this process is presented in the help section on the left
hand side of the Make panel. </li>
<li>A generator which defines the rules on how your items will be
wrapped to ultimately create the desired output file. The selection of a
generator within Make is optional. If you do not select a generator,
then Make will interface to Generate, where you can subsequently define
and invoke your generator. You will want to omit an generator the first
several times that you use Make, to allow you to fully understand how
Generate works and to build and save a generate configuration. Once you
begin to get comfortable with the overall flow of the Make and Generate,
you will be in a position to select one of your generators and then run
Make as a single step (bypassing the Generate step from Make). You can
only do this when you have defined and tested a generate configuration
and fully understand the end to end Make/Generate process.</li>
<li>A use case file which contains your specific routing/account use
cases (these are your test cases). Each record (input row) of the use
case file represents the data used to create a single check. You can
build your use case definitions with our Use Case Creator tool, or you
can build them from your own use cases, based on the actual data that
you want to utilize for a given test. A use case file must be created in
Excel format (XLS or CSV). Excel XLS files must be saved as an Excel
97-2003 workbook. </li>
<li>You can also use the output files created by export as a use case
file, where you would map the column definitions to those specific data
elements.</li>
<li>For x9, note that Make typically accepts the MICR OnUs field in its
component parts (field4, account, serial, and transaction code). But it
also allows you to specify a complete MICR OnUs field as well, which is
how the type 25 and 31 records are formatted. </li>
</ul>
<p>For each required check field that is manipulated by Make, you must
specify one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use case file input column where this data will be taken. For
example, if this is the ABA field and you have specified that in column
one, then you will indicate that here. Note that column numbering is
relative to one, so the first column is one (and not zero). </li>
<li>The rules to be used to assign the data if it is not present in your
use case file and it is instead to be statically or sequentially
assigned. For example, if you use case file does not contain the item
sequence number, you can specify a starting number and increment which
will be used to create item sequence numbers and assign them to checks
as they are created. For some fields on the Make panel, there is an
option to generate all possible values, which means that Make will use
the configuration rules to sequentially assign all of the defined values
for this field. </li>
</ul>
<p>Reformatters</p>
<p>Reformatters represent the power of the Make process since they
translate your use cases into the format required by Generate. There are
several reformatters that are included in the X9Assist distribution. You
should review these reformatters since they represent strategies that
can be used as a basis for developing your own use case reformatters.
</p>
<p>Although you can write your own programs to create the native input
required by Generate, Make can be used to virtually eliminate the need
for that, by performing these data translations for you. </p>
<p>The following reformatters are included in the X9Assist
distribution:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>x9</td>
<td>default937.Reformatter.xml</td>
<td>/ x9_assist / xml / makeItems / </td>
<td>This is a basic x9 reformatter which is designed to work with a
simple use case file that contains four columns: AuxOnUs, Routing,
Account, and Serial Number. This basic reformatter is provided as an
example but most probably will not be used in real world applications.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>x9</td>
<td>depositReformatter.xml</td>
<td>/ x9_assist / xml / makeItems / </td>
<td>This is a more complex x9 reformatter which is designed to work with
the depositFile.xlsx use case file, which is also provided with the
distribution. All users tend to manipulate the reformatter content to
meet their specific requirements, which is one of the benefits of using
Excel as the basis for these documents. Once you understand how this
reformatter works in conjunction with the sample use case file, you can
then modify these examples for your organization. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACH</td>
<td>There are a large number of reformatters for the ACH transaction
environment, where they are created by standard entry class and file
type (transactions, returns, dishonored, contested). These various
reformatters are stored into sub-folders by their respective file types.
</td>
<td><p>/ x9_assist / xml / makeAch / </p>
<p>See the table below for a complete list of the standard ACH
reformatters. </p></td>
<td>Similar to x9, these reformatters can be used as the basis to create
your specific reformatters, based on your specific requirements. Because
of that, you should not modify our standard reformatters. If you
mistakenly modify a standard system reformatter, you can just delete it
and X9Assist will automatically recreate it during the next user
session. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CPA005</td>
<td>defaultCp5.reformatter.xml</td>
<td>/ x9_assist / xml / makeCpa005 /</td>
<td>This reformatter is used to work with Canadian electronic CPA005
files. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Saving and Reusing Reformatters</p>
<p>You can create new reformatters and save them for future use, and can
assign your own name to the reformatter based on the purpose. This will
allow you to build a library of reformatters that can be repetitively
used for explicit test generation purposes. </p>
<p>Generators</p>
<p>Make/Generate is an integrated process where the reformatter and the
generator are both accessible during the make process. Make allows a
generator to be loaded, modified, saved, and ultimately used to create
the output file. This process is extremely integrated. </p>
<p>Use of Heading Lines </p>
<p>Excel workbooks often include heading lines that provide instructions
on usage. These are present as help (or tips) as to how the columns
within the workbook should be populated. These leading lines within the
workbook can be tagged with an “H” in the comment column to indicate
that they are headings and not items. Excel conditional formatting can
be used within your reformatter definition to color code heading rows
based on presence of the “H” value. </p>
<p>Use of Comments</p>
<p>Comment lines are identified by placing an asterisk (*) in either the
comment column or in the item type column, as identified by your
reformatter. You can use the comment facility for various purposes. For
example, a given item can be disabled (which will not be generated) by
flagging it as a comment. Or, you can place comment lines within your
use case file to describe the purpose of the test, information about
specific test cases, or the originator of various bundles. Excel
conditional formatting can be used within your reformatter definition to
color code comment rows based on presence of the “*” value. </p>
<p>New Batches / Bundles</p>
<p>Items can be started in a new bundle in one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The item count per bundle is exceeded (as defined in your
generator).</li>
<li>The item is a credit, and your generator indicates that credits
should begin in a new bundle.</li>
<li>The item has a value of “B” in the “NewBundleOrCashLetter” column as
identified by your reformatter. </li>
<li>You populate differing values in Bundle Cycle Number, Bundle User
Field, or both of these columns. A new bundle is started automatically
when these columns are populated and the values for the current bundle
have changed. </li>
<li>You indicate that an item should begin in a new bundle using the
item type indicator column, where you instead the keyword “Batch” (or
“Bundle”) on a row by itself. When you do this, the row is treated as a
separator line identifying the start of a new bundle, and will be
otherwise ignored. The row will trigger the next item to begin in a new
bundle. </li>
</ul>
<p>New Cash Letters</p>
<p>Items can be started in a new cash letter in one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The item has a value of “CL” in the “NewBundleOrCashLetter” column
as identified by your reformatter. </li>
<li>You indicate that an item should begin in a new cash letter using
the item type indicator column, where you insert the keyword
“CashLetter” on a row by itself. When you do this, the row is treated as
a separator line identifying the start of a new cash letter, and will be
otherwise ignored. The row will trigger the next item to begin in a new
cash letter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Character Set and Print Fonts </p>
<p>Make uses the ISO 8859-1 character set to internally represent
strings that can be drawn within item images. ISO 8859-1 is an 8-bit,
single-byte coded graphic character set that encodes what it refers to
as "Latin alphabet no. 1", consisting of 191 characters from the Latin
script. ISO 8859-1 is commonly used throughout the Americas and Western
Europe and specifically includes the French diacritical accents. </p>
<p>Any character that is included in the ISO 8859-1 character set can be
utilized within your use case files and can be included within images
drawn by Make. This is especially useful when creating data string that
will be used for the Payee Name field of a Make item. You can search for
topic “ISO/IEC 8859-1” on Wikipedia to get more information on ISO
8859-1 and the specific characters that are included in this character
set. </p>
<p>Also remember that for special characters to be drawn within your
images, they need to first be included within ISO 8859-1, but then also
defined in the font that is defined for that particular field within
your Make template. These templates are system defined but can also be
modified to meet your specific needs. Templates are located in folder /
Users / YourUserId / Documents / x9_assist / xml / templates /. There
are separate folders by category (eg, retail, business, etc). Here is an
example of the Payee Name field on one of our templates, showing that it
is printed using font “handwriting5.ttf”. This font is internally
defined within the X9Assist program launch folder. You can modify
templates to use other fonts subject to your specific needs. </p>
<p> &lt;field&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;fieldName&gt;payeeName&lt;/fieldName&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;x&gt;0.90&lt;/x&gt; &lt;y&gt;1.12&lt;/y&gt;
&lt;length&gt;3.00&lt;/length&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;font&gt;handwriting5.ttf&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;fontSize&gt;60&lt;/fontSize&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;/field&gt;</p>
<p>To test the ability to print specific characters, a good approach is
to start your testing using an application such as MS-Word or Libre
Office-Writer. Create a new document and enter text that contains the
specific characters that you want to print. Select this text and change
it to the font that you want to use for this Make field, that is defined
within your Make template. You can now print this test page to determine
if the text will print as expected. If any characters are translated to
“?” then they are not supported by the chosen font. </p>
<p>Use Case Files </p>
<p>Our general intention is that you should not modify our templates,
but alternatively use them as the basis to either save or further
develop your own spreadsheets subject to your specific requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two X9 use case file examples. One is very basic
(useCase100) while the second is a more “real world” example
(depositFile.xlsx). </li>
<li>There are also several ACH use case examples, which represent all
commonly used NACHA transaction formats. These templates can be used as
provided, or can also serve as a basis for developing your own use case
templates. Where appropriate, these use case files will create balanced
files, by automatically inserting an offsetting item which will net the
file to zero. These templates have separate tabs (worksheets) for
various standard entry classes. The reason for this is that the columns
within the templates vary based on the specific data requirements.
Because of this, you cannot combine multiple standard entry classes into
a single worksheet. If you need to create an ACH file with more than one
standard entry class, then the files should be created separately and
then merged. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our standard use case templates (included in the X9Assist
distribution) are stored in folder / x9_assist / lists / useCases / as
follows: </p>

<p>Printing Out Of File Item IRDs </p>
<p>Make includes a predefined process that can be utilized to print IRDs
when you have the front/back images in your archive, but you do not have
an ICL or ICLR file that contains those returns. This process can be
used to print forward presentment original items as forward replacement
original IRDs, or return items as subsequent IRDs. The process consists
of the following steps: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Look in your folder: / Documents / x9_assist / lists / useCases/,
where you will need to have file outOfFileItems.xlsm. If you do not have
that file, then you need to upgrade to the most current version of
X9Assist, which can be downloaded from our website. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Look in your folder: / Documents / x9_assist / xml / makeItems /,
where you will need files irdOutOfFileOriginals.reformatter.xml and
irdOutOfFileReturns.reformatter.xml in your makeItems folder. If you do
not have those files, then you need to upgrade to the most current
version of X9Assist, which can be downloaded from our website. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Look in your folder: / Documents / x9_assist / xml / generate /,
where you will need files irdOutOfFileOriginals.Generator.xml and
irdOutOfFileReturns.Generator.xml. If you do not have those files, then
you need to upgrade to the most current version of X9Assist, which can
be downloaded from our website. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Using outOfFileItems.xlsm as a basis, create a new file of the items
to be generated by this overall process. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This file should be similarly saved into the useCases folder. Please
do not change our original template file. Instead, you should always
make copies of this and adjust as needed for your organization. We
highly suggest creating a new Excel file for each new IRD print run.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use the Validate button to verify that the entered data is formatted
correctly. The validate button can be used repeatedly as data is
entered, just to confirm that there are no errors.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Save when your items are entered and validated. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Start X9Assist.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>From the toolbar, run Make (which is the lightning bolt) on the
toolbar.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Load the reformatter, which is either
irdOutOfFileOriginals.reformatter.xml or
irdOutOfFileReturns.reformatter.xml.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Load the generator, which is either
irdOutOfFileOriginals.Generator.xml or

<li><blockquote>
<p>Load the use case file, which is will be your items file as entered
via Excel. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Verify that there are no input data errors.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Press the make button at the bottom of the Make panel. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Review the file that is created. This will be an ICL (originals) or
ICLR (returns). </p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>From the toolbar menus, run / Print / Print IRDs /.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Review options and then press the Format button.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>You are now positioned within the Print Images panel with the
“irdList” selected (this list was automatically created by
PrintIRDs.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>All of the options are pre-selected for IRD print in 3x1 format on

<li><blockquote>
<p>Preview (if you want) to take a look at the formatted IRDs.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Select Print which will initiate the printing process.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Once completed, you most probably want to save the xlsm use case file
to a unique file (using a time stamped name, or whatever) so you can
reference and reprint these in the future. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>ACH and Reformatters Use Case Templates</p>
<p>As you can see above, each use case file template can be utilized to
create transactions for one or more standard entry classes. The standard
entry class will be assigned by the chosen reformatter, and not within
the use case file. </p>
<p>If you decide to create your own customized reformatters, you can
utilize our standard reformatter for that entry class as the basis and
starting point. There may be fields that will always contain a constant
value, and if so, they can be moved into the reformatter and eliminated
as a column within the use case file. </p>
<p>ACH entry classes are assigned to predefined templates as documented
in the table below. For example CCD is assign to template T05 for
transactions, R05 for returns, D05 for dishonored returns, and C05 for
contested dishonored returns. Within a given XLS use case file, the
template identifier must be present in cell B1. This setting identifies
the template column definition, and is used by Make to ensure that the
reformatter matches the use case file that is being read. </p>

<p>ACH <strong>VBA Script </strong></p>
<p>Our standard ACH use case files include a VBA script that can be
invoked using the “Validate” button. Typically, data validation will be
done (using the validate button) as part of the save process, before you
exit Excel. Transactions must be located in the “Data” tab. If errors
are found during the validation process, they will be loaded into the
“(Errors)” tab. The validation script uses the “FIELDS” row as a
definition of the attributes of each column within the worksheet. Data
validation begins at the first row after the FIELDS row and continues
through the remainder of the sheet. Commend rows (with * in column one)
and heading rows (with H in column one) are excluded from the validation
process. </p>
<p>The FIELDS row defines the attributes of the data that can be entered
into the corresponding column. The value for a given column will consist
of a number followed by zero or more data attribute characters. The
number represents the maximum number of characters that can be entered
into this column. The attributes can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>N = numeric</li>
<li>R = required</li>
<li>A = amount</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of column attribute strings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 = maximum of 10 characters</li>
<li>10R = maximum of 10 characters and the value cannot be
blank/omitted</li>
<li>10NR = maximum of 10 characters and the value must be numeric </li>
<li>10A = maximum of 10 digits as an amount, which may contain a decimal
point</li>
<li>10AR = maximum of of 10 digits as an amount, and a value must be
entered </li>
</ul>
<p>Creating Balanced ACH Files</p>
<p>ACH files can be either “balanced” or “unbalanced”. Balanced files
contain an offsetting entry that automatically credits/debits the
customer’s offset account for the debit and/or credit transactions that
are present within the file. A debit file will contain an offsetting
credit, while a credit file will contain an offsetting debit. From the
bank’s perspective, a balanced file nets to zero, since the total amount
of the transactions are offset by the balancing entry, which means that
the net of debits and credits will be zero. Unbalanced files do not have
this offsetting entry. Unbalanced files can be all credits, all debits
or a mixture of debits and credits that probably do not balance against
each other. When an unbalanced file is generated,, the receiving
financial institution must make a manual entry to credit/debit the
customer’s account for the activity. The bottom line is that transaction
files must ultimately always net to a logical zero. The only question is
where the balancing entry will be created. Typically, if your financial
institution has required that you prefund ACH Activity, you will be
required to submit unbalanced. Most financial institutions require
balanced files since the files are self-posting, manual entry mistakes
are eliminated.</p>
<p>Our use case files are created using Excel, which makes the creation
of a balancing entry relatively easy since an Excel formula can be used
to automatically calculate the offsetting transaction that is required.
There are several important considerations for this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The balancing entry should typically be the last item within your
transaction file.</li>
<li>The balancing entry is defined by putting the string SETL in column
one. </li>
<li>The balancing entry will be created in its own batch, making it
readily identifiable. </li>
<li>The balancing entry amount can be assigned explicitly or via an
Excel formula. </li>
<li>The balancing entry will have a system created description of
“Settlement Entry”. </li>
</ul>
<p>Use Case File Tips</p>
<p>The following tips are helpful when creating your use case files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The comment column must always be the first column (“A”) within your
document. </li>
<li>Header lines (those at the top of your spreadsheet) can be
identified with an “H” in the comment column. This is done by tradition
as a unique way to tag those lines.</li>
<li>Comment lines (any row that is not considered to contain use case
data) should have an asterisk (“*”) in the comment column. For example,
you can use comment lines to separate your data into logical groups or
further identify the source or purpose of specific test cases. </li>
<li>A spreadsheet row that has absolutely no populated data will be
discarded and will not create a resulting item. </li>
<li>Identify each individual transaction row as either a debit or credit
(D=Debit, C=Credit). A row will default to a debit when no value is
present. </li>
<li>Note that you can have credits defined throughout your Make file,
and you can also have multiple credits offset by your debits when that
is a requirement. You can complete control over the order of the
individual items. </li>
<li>Items will automatically fill each batch/bundle unless overridden in
one of several alternative manners. </li>
<li>Within Generate, you can indicate that each credit should begin in a
new batch. </li>
<li>You can also insert a row within the use case file that has “batch”
in the item type column, which will forcibly begin a new batch at that
point within the generated file. In this scenario, the use case row is
blank except for the inserted bundle identifier. </li>
<li>Define all needed item related fields and assign appropriate values.
</li>
<li>For x9, define the Payee, Memo, and name/address text strings that
will be inserted into virtual images as they are dynamically drawn.
</li>
<li>For x9, define the specific check format that you want used (if you
leave this column blank, then the check format will be sequentially
assigned by Generate). </li>
<li>Consider using customized Excel calculations to automatically assign
values based on your specific requirements; for example, you could
assign the transaction code automatically from the ABA column. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific requirements regarding the creation of your use case
files:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can provide a fully defined MICR OnUs field or the individual
field components. If you provide the fully defined MICR OnUs, that value
is taken first and will override any values that you provide for the
individual fields. </li>
<li>If you provide both Aux OnUs and a check serial number, then the Aux
OnUs field is taken first and your serial number will not be used. </li>
<li>If you need an eight digit ABA value encoded, then you need to
provide that value with the dash in the ABA column. For example you must
provide the value of 1234-5678. Providing the actual dash in the ABA
field in the indicator that you do not have an ABA check digit. </li>
<li>Make has extensive support for the type 68 user record. Please refer
to that topic for specific information on how to define and create your
custom user records. </li>
<li>Make includes support for the fixed and variable formats of the type
27 and type 34 addendum records. Please refer to that topic for more
information on creating those record types. </li>
</ul>
<p>Process Control Field (For X9)</p>
<p>Most banks use the process control field for two separate purposes.
The first is to specify an optional transaction code that for their
internal processing. The second is to provide the check serial number on
consumer (retail) checks. </p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction code is typically one or two digits.</li>
<li>The check serial number is typically four digits. </li>
<li>Your reformatter can define creation rules for both your check
serial number and the transaction code. Note that both of these are
optional, so either one or both may be present. </li>
<li>The process control field can then be constructed as a combination
of your check serial number and your transaction code. An option is
provided to allow the transaction code to be appended to the left or to
the right of your check serial number. </li>
</ul>
<p>OnUs Field (For X9)</p>
<p>Make allows you to construct the OnUs field by defining several
fields which will then be combined (optional field 4, account number,
serial, and transaction code). As an alternative, Make allows you to
provide the OnUs field in its entirety, formatted exactly as you want
it. This does require that you provide the separator symbols (“/”)
between the various logical elements within OnUs. </p>
<p>MICR Line (For X9)</p>
<p>Make normally constructs the MICR line from the individual use case
fields (AuxOnUs, EPC, Routing, OnUs, and Amount) that are then formatted
per standard MICR line construction rules. There may be times when you
want to assume control of MICR line formatting. This type of override
processing is typically used in support of negative testing where you
need to explicitly format the MICR line. Several examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application requires non-standard MICR lines.</li>
<li>You want to purposefully create images (and perhaps printed items)
with invalid MICR lines for negative use case testing. </li>
</ul>
<p>In support of this, Make allows you to format your own MICR line
which can be provided via your use case file. User input is typically
limited to valid E13B characters. Make does not block the presence of
other characters which may be useful for specific negative testing. The
following E13B characters would typically be present in your use case
file:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 through 9 (the numeric MICR line digits) </li>
<li>A (transit symbol)</li>
<li>B (amount symbol)</li>
<li>C (OnUs symbol) </li>
<li>D (dash symbol) </li>
<li>b (a single blank) </li>
<li>* (digit error) </li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a user provided MICR line would be as follows: </p>
<p> A057770930Ab20915353C7837bbbbbbB0000010000B</p>
<p>CMC-7 MICR Line Encoding (For X9)</p>
<p>Make/Generate has the ability to create test items using CMC-7 item
level encoding, which is based on the CMC-7 encoding standards as
documented by ISO 1004. The CMC-7 font is widely used for checks and
drafts throughout Europe, South America, and various other countries
around the world. The CMC-7 character set consists of the ten numbers
(0-9), five special symbols (S1 through S5), and twenty six letters.
</p>
<p>Each country has their own unique layout for their encoded CMC-7 MICR
line which incorporate their unique data elements and encoding. These
layouts vary due to the internal identification and routing requirements
as defined by each respective country. Because of these variations, it
is important that you understand the CMC-7 requirements for the
countries to be generated.</p>
<p>Make/Generate accommodate these differences through two
facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make allows you to take complete control of the MICR line format at
the item level. For CMC-7, this includes use of the S1 through S5
special symbols (internally defined as A through E) within user provided
MICR line data. </li>
<li>Generate allows you to select the MICR font to be used for MICR font
to be used for encoding. This font selection is made on the “image” tab.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of CMC7 formatted MICR data lines which would be provided as
input to Make and then used by Generate to format items are as follows
(note the use of A-E and b for blanks): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>C4440101bC123456789123Eb111122223333A</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>C4440102E0182Cb4014Eb111122223333Bb4227A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Credits (For X9)</p>
<p>An input file to Make/Generate typically has a single credit (which
offsets the checks that are present), but in more complex testing
scenarios you may have multiple credits present. There are two
approaches that can be used to create credits within the Make
process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include the credit(s) in your Make/Generate input. When using this
approach, you have total control over the order of the credits relative
to the debits, and you also have total control of the amount that this
present on the credits themselves. Remember that credits are identified
within Make use case input using the "ItemType" column, which must be
populated with "C" to indicate that an individual item is a credit (and
not a debit which is a "D"). To take absolute control over the credit
amount, you can explicitly include the required amount within the credit
item. In this situation, your provided credit amount will be used (it
will not be calculated). You can alternatively set the credit amount to
zero, which indicates that you want the amount to be auto-calculated by
Make/Generate, based on the offsetting debits which are present. Use of
auto-calculate is required if you are having Make/Generate insert the
credit into your ICL file (since the credit does not otherwise appear).
It is also helpful even when you include the credit in your use case
file, when the checks may change from test to test and you always want
the file to be in balance. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your generator can indicate that an offsetting credit should be
automatically created and inserted. When this is needed, indicators must
be set on two separate Generator panels. First is on the Generate tab
itself, where you must indicate that credit (type 61/62) records are to
be created. Second is on the Credits tab, where you must indicate the
attributes of the credit record to be manufactured and inserted. When
using this approach, there will be a single credit which is inserted
using the defined attributes to offset the debits which are present in
your use case file. The inserted credit will be immediately after the
bundle header (this sequence is typically described as credits first).
The credit amount will be automatically calculated from the offsetting
checks. This is typically defined as an ICL (image cash letter) which
contains a single credit offset by the presents checks. </li>
</ul>
<p>Generate also supports multiple credit scenarios. When this is
needed, the credits must be present within your use case file. They
cannot be automatically created and inserted by Make/Generate, since
their exactly position would be unknown. In this situation you can have
a series of transactions, each of which consists of a credit offset by
its corresponding debits. Depending on your requirements, there can also
be more complex transactions, where you have multiple credits offset by
multiple debits. Obviously, in these complex scenarios, you use case
input is responsible for both the credit amounts as well as their
logical sequence. </p>
<p>Depending on your requirements, credits may or may not require
images. If images are to be created, you must indicate this on the
Generate tab using the “create credit images” check box.</p>
<p>Addenda (For X9)</p>
<p>Make/Generate supports the creation of both primary (BOFD or Bank of
First Deposit) and secondary endorsements, which are attached to each
generated use case item. It is important to remember that creation of
endorsement records must be enabled on the Generate tab when using these
facilities. No addendum records will be created if those corresponding
check boxes have not been enabled. </p>
<p>The primary endorsements are record type 26 (for ICL) and record type
32 (for ICLR). The secondary endorsements are record type 28 (for ICL)
and record type 35 (for ICLR). Record types 26/28 will be attached to
the type 25 check detail record. Record types 32/35 will be attached to
the type 31 return detail record. </p>
<p>The most typical use of Make/Generate is to manufacture specific test
data that evolves around use case items. Within this underlying purpose,
endorsements are created as necessary attachments since they will be
required by those image enabled applications which process the generated
files. These creation of these endorsements is associated with the need
to create a logically complete file, and less about the specific content
of the endorsements themselves. To that end, Make/Generate provides
facilities to build both the primary and secondary endorsements around
these specific needs. </p>
<p>Items can optionally have a single primary endorsement using a
specified routing. All primary endorsements will have this same routing.
By default, the first endorsement will always have the truncation
indicator set to “Y”. This default behavior is can be disabled using a
check box on the addenda panel. </p>
<p>Items can optionally have multiple secondary endorsements (from 0 to
99). The routing can be either assigned from a specifically assigned
number, or can be randomly selected from a user provided list.
Generating a single secondary endorsement with a fixed routing is the
most commonly used approach for testing. However, in more complex
situations, the routing can be assigned from a user constructed list
which represents your exchange partners. Assignment from the list allows
files to be generated the mimic your production environment. </p>
<p>Invalid Image Test Cases (For X9)</p>
<p>Generate has many capabilities, one of which is to create invalid
image test cases. Our invalid image function provides a mechanism to
create flawed images that can be sent to your capture systems to see how
they react to these various scenarios. The list of invalid image
variants has increased over time and we are open to suggestions as to
improvements for this facility. </p>
<p>To use this function, you must select the “draw new images” option on
the parameters panel (on the left). This process has numerous available
options: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can select the invalid image test cases to be generated.</li>
<li>Check boxes are provided which allow you to easily select all tests
or entire groups.</li>
<li>You must indicate the number of images to be generated per test
case, which will default to one when not entered. </li>
<li>The invalid image scenario is incorporated into the front side
image. Depending on the test case, the resulting image may or may not be
be viewable. This is dependent on the type of structural error which has
been selected for that image.</li>
<li>The invalid image test case name is drawn into the back side image
which is otherwise not modified by this process. This means that each
invalid image test case can be easily identified by looking that the
corresponding back side image. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using Make to Create Very Large Files</p>
<p>Make can be used to create very large x9 files. Although Make does
not have an internal limitation on the number of items within a single
file (within reason). While the XLS file format is limited to a maximum
of 65,536 rows, XLSX and CSV do not have this limitation. Thus, those
data formats can be be used to represent use case definitions with a
very large number of items. </p>
<p>View</p>
<p>Once you define your reformatter rules, you can use the “View” button
to view the checks that would be created by Make. This preview allows
you to check your work before you actually generate a file. The test
results are displayed within the Text Editor in CSV format. </p>
<p>You should always preview the output from your new reformatter rules
to see if they are creating checks in the manner that you expect, prior
to actually running generate. </p>
<p>View will display the Make created fields as they have been
manufactured per your defined parameters. This field list represents the
internal interface from Make to Generate.</p>
<p>View allows you to see your Make results without actually running
Generate. This allows you to view your field mapping to ensure that you
are creating your fields as expected. You can make adjustments to your
mapping and repeat this process until you get the output you expect.
</p>
<p>View allows you to save your Make results to your own external file.
This would allow you to take your Make results, make additional
modifications, and then bring the modified file directly into Generate.
You can do this if you have requirements that cannot be directly
supported by the Make process. </p>
<p>Generate</p>
<p>When you select generate, checks will be created and written to an
intermediate file which will be sent to the standard X9Assist Generate
function. You will be presented with the Generate panel where you can
specify your generate parameters to create a new output file. Generate
allows configurations to be saved, which makes that process configurable
and reusable similar to Make. </p>
