is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or as a
business entity) and X9Ware LLC ( referred to as “licensor”), for your
use of the above identified product(s) and associated materials. By
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree
to be bound by the terms of this EULA. This EULA represents the entire
agreement concerning the use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT between you and

understanding between the parties. If you do not agree to the terms of
this EULA, do not install or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. If future changes

hereby licensed by X9Ware to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on your
workstations, computers, or electronic devices for the defined duration

which is unique to a company or user name, the licensing level, the
license expiration date, and the program release. The license key must
be used only by the party it has been issued to and must not be shared
with others. The Licensee must protect the confidentiality of the
license key with the same care as with any of their own proprietary
data. Your license key is activated after making confirmed payment to
X9Ware. You may distribute the license key within your organization as
needed in accordance with your licensing level. This licensing agreement
does not cover private label (branded) solutions, where the intent is
distribution of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to your clients and customers. Any
such licensing arrangement will require more extensive discussions and
agreements between both parties. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a) Proprietary Information. Licensee recognizes that X9Ware regards
the Licensed Programs as its proprietary information and as confidential
trade secrets of great value. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>b) Confidentiality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Definitions. By virtue of this Agreement, a party (“Receiving
Party”) may have access to information from the other party or its
affiliates (“Disclosing Party”) that would reasonably be considered
proprietary or confidential, including but not limited to the Disclosing
Party’s or its affiliates’ employees, customer lists and data, financial
information, technical information, business plans, organization,
policies, or products (“Confidential Information”). Confidential
Information shall include any written reports, findings, conclusions,
recommendations, or reporting data and analysis prepared by Disclosing
Party and provided to Receiving Party under this Agreement, or
information that due to its nature or the circumstances of its
disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would
understand to be confidential or proprietary of a party.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

received from a third party free to disclose such information without

thereof, but only to the extent of and for the purposes of such order,
and only if the receiving party first notifies the disclosing party of
the order and permits the disclosing party to seek an appropriate
protective order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(iii) Use and Nondisclosure. Receiving Party agrees to hold
Confidential Information in confidence. Receiving Party agrees not to
collect or use Confidential Information for any purpose other than for
the implementation of and business purposes expressly set forth in this

(collectively the “Representatives”) on a need-to-know basis only and
under obligations of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those
contained herein.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(iv) Degree of Care. Receiving Party agrees to use the same degree of
care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a
similar nature and value, but in no event less than a reasonable
standard of care, to ensure that Confidential Information are not

provisions of this Agreement. Such care shall include, but not be

technical and procedural safeguards to: (i) ensure the security and
confidentiality of Confidential Information, (ii) protect against any
anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of
Confidential Information, and (iii) protect against unauthorized access
to or use of Confidential Information which could result in substantial
harm or inconvenience to Disclosing Party. Receiving Party represents

have access to any Confidential Information) which enable it to comply
with the terms of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving
Party shall be responsible for any breaches of this nondisclosure
provision by any of its Representatives. Receiving Party shall promptly
report to Disclosing Party any unauthorized disclosure or use of
Confidential Information by Receiving Party or its agents of which
Receiving Party becomes aware.</p>

personally identifiable information provided by Disclosing Party to
Receiving Party or learned by Receiving Party hereunder may only be used
for conducting the business transactions that are the subject of the
Agreement. Disclosing Party does not consent to Receiving Party’s use of
any personally identifiable information provided by Disclosing Party or
any of its Representatives, for any other purpose than for conducting
business transactions that are subject of the Agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(vi) Length of Obligation and Return of Information. Receiving Party
shall at any time upon the Disclosing Party’s written request either
return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party’s option, the Disclosing
Party’s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Receiving Party may keep a copy of Confidential Information solely for
maintaining reasonably appropriate business records or as may be
required by law. Confidential Information shall be subject to these
provisions for five (5) years after termination of the Agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

notify Disclosing Party of any material unauthorized possession, use or
knowledge, or attempt thereof, of Confidential Information by any person
or entity which may become known to it; 2) promptly furnish to

knowledge, or attempt thereof, and assist Disclosing Party in
