<p>The Duplicate Items Detector can identify duplicate items either
within the currently loaded x9 file, or across multiple x9 files.
Duplicates can be identified for the following types of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check detail records (type 25)</li>
<li>Return detail records (type 31)</li>
<li>Credit reconciliation records (type 61) </li>
</ul>
<p>Duplicates are considered within record type, which means (for
example) that you cannot have a duplicate that consists of a debit and a
credit, even if they have the same MICR line and amount.</p>
<p>Duplicates within the current X9 File</p>
<p>When you open the duplicate panel, X9Assist will automatically search
for duplicates within the current x9 file (using default duplicate
criteria) and will inform you of how many duplicate items were located.
</p>
<p>You can then change the duplicate criteria as you see fit and use the
“Check” button to initiate another duplicate search.</p>
<p>The following criteria can be included in the identification of
duplicate items:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABA number</li>
<li>OnUs field (which in most cases will include the consumer check
serial number) </li>
<li>Auxiliary AuxOnUs </li>
<li>External Processing Code (EPC) </li>
<li>Amount</li>
<li>Item Sequence Number </li>
</ul>
<p>When you have duplicates, X9Assist will display a screen that shows
you both sides of each duplicate occurrence. The duplicate items panel
has a divider (“=================”) between each duplicate case. </p>
<p>Each duplicate provides information on the key (“duplicate […]”) that
was used to identify the duplicate, which is based on the criteria that
you have specified. Each duplicate also provides information on the
source of the duplicate item (“from file….”). </p>
<p>There will be two or more lines reported for each duplicate. Each
line has a prefix that will tell you the file, record number, and record
type that was the source of the duplicate item. Note that a single item
may be duplicated with one or more other items, hence there can be two
or more lines that are shown between each of the dividers.</p>
<p>The following buttons are available from the Duplicate Items Detector
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: initiates another duplicate items analysis
and is used when you have changed the criteria and want to update the
results based on your new selections. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>: creates a new filter for those items that
are duplicates within the current x9 file. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: deletes those items that are duplicates
within the current x9 file. You will be asked to confirm the delete
before it is initiated. The deleted items are added to the current
modification log (as supported by Modify). This will allow you to review
the deleted items and revert any of the items as you so desire. You will
need to run a Repair to correct trailer totals. Also note that if this
file contains credits and you are deleting the debits, then the credit
amount(s) will also have to be modified. Once your review of the x9 file
is completed, you can save the modified file to a new x9 file name.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Duplicates Across Multiple X9 Files</p>
<p>The Duplicate Items Detector can be used to identify duplicates that
exist across multiple x9 files. The identification of such duplicates
can become a complex process and X9Assist provides tools to help in
these difficult situations. </p>
<p>Suppose you have duplicates that involve three different files. In
this example, you would do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use X9Assist to open what you consider to be your primary x9 file
associated with this event. This is the only file that you will be able
to use for the “Filter” and “Delete” functions. </li>
<li>Launch the Duplicate Detector for this file.</li>
<li>Within the Duplicate Detector, use the “open” button on the tool bar
to open the second file. You will get a popup message of how many items
were found and loaded from this file. </li>
<li>Within the Duplicate Detector, use the “open” button on the tool bar
to open the third file. You will get a popup message of how many items
were found and loaded from this file. </li>
<li>Now assign your duplicate items criteria</li>
<li>Press the “Check” button. </li>
<li>You will get a popup message that identifies the number of duplicate
items that have been found.</li>
<li>If necessary, you can adjust your duplicate identification criteria
and hit “Check” again.</li>
<li>As necessary, you can repeat this process.</li>
<li>You can now use the “Filter” button to allow you to generate a list
of the duplicate items that exist within the first file that you
opened.</li>
</ol>
<p>Duplicate Reporting</p>
<p>The Duplicate Detector generates a display of all identified
duplicate items so that you will know which items and which files are
involved in the duplicate scenario. You can save this text file which
provides great insight into the items that are participating in your
duplicate event. </p>
<p>Duplicates within the current x9 file can be inserted in a filter.
You can Use the Excel Exporter to export these items into an Excel
workbook. </p>
<p>As you are well aware, duplicate items situations are always complex
and demanding. X9Assist provides generic tools that are designed to
provide help and guidance. Please let us know how we can improve upon
these tools. As always, your suggestions are welcome. </p>
