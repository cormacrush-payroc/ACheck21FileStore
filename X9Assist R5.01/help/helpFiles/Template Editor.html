<p>Check image creation within X9Assist, as utilized by Make/Generate,
can be extended with your own custom artwork. This includes
modifications to our predefined templates (for example, changing a font
size or definition) or adding your own templates. Image formats are
defined within predefined categories, which are retail (for wallet side
checks), business (for commercial size checks that include the auxiliary
OnUs field), and credits. These category definitions may be extended in
the future based on user requirements.</p>
<p>The Template Editor allows the image templates used by Make/Generate
to be viewed, modified, created, and saved. Template definitions are xml
files stored in the / documents / x9_assist / xml / templates / folder.
Overall, this process can become complex, and use of this tool should be
considered as an advanced topic. We recommend that you frequently backup
the xml template definitions when the Template Editor is being used.
</p>
<p>The editor provides functionality in two areas. First is that it
allows the x/y positions of template fields to be updated based on their
visual placement within the template. Without this, the process of
adjusting positions is very complex, since you cannot easily determine
the overlay positions of the various template fields. Second is that the
editor eliminates the need to manually update the associated xml files
needed to support templates. Without the editor, these xml files must be
updated on a manual basis using tools such as NotePad, NotePad++, or
WordPad. </p>
<p>This editor makes the process of creating and updating those
parameters much easier than the alternative of using a simple text
editor (eg, NotePad or NotePad++). Using our Template Editor eliminates
the xml document errors that can often result from that alternative
process. This editor allows you to concentrate on content and not all of
the technical intricacies that are associated with an XML file. </p>
<p>Functionality </p>
<p>The editor allows existing templates to be viewed and modified. It
also allows new templates to be added or deleted. All needed xml files
(including templates.xml) are updated. </p>
<p>The editor also includes a rudimentary paint tool. We realize that
the paint tools are very basic, but there are enough tools to allow
basic templates to be drawn. The editor allows an existing template to
be saved with an alternate name, allowing it to be the basis for new
work. This is the only available method for creating a new template.
</p>
<p>The paint tools include basic shapes including line, rectangle, and
text, along with undo and redo. These shapes can be drawn onto the
underlying image, and will be burned into the template image when saved.
The paint tools are an attempt to simplify your template development
work. They are not envisioned as the end-all that would completely
eliminate the need to use other tools such as MS-Paint or Gimp. </p>
<p>The editor displays the currently loaded template image within a
drawing canvas in the upper left panel. Mouse coordinates are displayed
on the toolbar as the move is moved within the panel. Our drawing
actions are located on the toolbar, and you should read through the
popup help that is associated with each functional icon.</p>
<p>The editor also displays the fields that have x-y coordinates for
this template. These fields are shown within the lower panel, where the
data can be modified. For example, to move a template field to a new
position on the drawing canvas, move the mouse to where you want the
field to be positioned. Make note of the mouse x-y coordinates and then
enter those positions within the field table. You will see that the
field is then moved accordingly within the canvas. </p>
<p>Fields can be displayed using either an X9Assist font or a System
font. The X9Assist fonts are internally defined and always available.
The System fonts are dependent on the fonts that are available within
the system font directory for the current workstation. You need to be
careful when using System fonts, since these fonts are not permanent;
they may come and go.</p>
<p>As part of saving a template, the image will always be written in
black-white TIFF, regardless of the original format. This is an image
exchange (x9.100-181) standard. </p>
<p>Delete formats WITH CARE. You should never delete a system supplied
format, since X9Assist is dependent on the existence of these templates.
</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>The editor supports the following tools: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Text – adds specific text where the font and size can be
selected.</li>
<li>Line – draws a straight line, which can be dragged to size. </li>
<li>Rectangle – draws a rectangle, which can be dragged to size. </li>
<li>Draw – allows free form text to be drawn, using the current brush
size. </li>
<li>Erase – allows image pixels to be cleared, using the current brush
size. </li>
<li>Copy – copies the shape that is current positioned under the
mouse.</li>
<li>Remove – removes the shape that is current positioned under the
mouse.</li>
<li>Move – moves the shape that is current positioned under the
mouse.</li>
<li>Resize – resizes the shape that is current positioned under the
mouse.</li>
<li>Undo – repetitively undo the last action.</li>
<li>Redo – repetitively redo the last action.</li>
<li>Save – saves the current template to the name and category
identified on the right-side panel. The current template can be saved as
an alternate name, which can then be edited.</li>
<li>Delete – deletes the current template.</li>
<li>Reset – resets the editor.</li>
<li>Cancel – exits the editor. </li>
</ol>
<p>Manual Updates (not using the Editor) </p>
<p>If you decide to update templates on a manual basis (not using the
editor), then the following steps must be followed when adding check
artwork:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a third party paint tool to create your check artwork. You can
look at our existing formats in the x9assist/images folder to get a good
idea of how the current check image formats have been designed. </li>
<li>A key part of your design is to ensure that MICR band (the bottom
9/16 of an inch) remains blank at the bottom of the image. </li>
<li>When creating your check formats, you must consider the size
(especially the length) based on your desire to support the Aux OnUs
field which is required on business checks. Your check formats must also
be defined within the minimum and maximums per industry standards. </li>
<li>Our check formats were designed and drawn using Photoshop which
allows a very clear and sharp image to be created. You could do the same
using other tools such as GIMP or MS-Paint. Depending on your
requirements, this can become a somewhat complex task and does require a
good working knowledge of the image design tools that you select.
MS-Paint is especially good for adding overly text to an existing image.
</li>
<li>The images should be saved in black-white format, either as TIFF or
PNG. We have found this a bit complex using some of the above mentioned
image tools, but we have found this conversion much easier using
IrfanView64. Obviously, your choice of tools is up to you. </li>
<li>The template images must be saved at 240 DPI. </li>
<li>Each format has a front image and an optional back image. </li>
<li>Once the images are created and in black-white format, they should
be store your created image format(s) in folder: / Program Launch /
X9Ware LLC / X9Assist Rx.xx /images/. You can take look at our images to
get a feeling for how they were saved. </li>
<li><p>All check formats are defined in multiple places, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Each format is defined in “templates.xml” within folder / xml /
templates /. This is an index of all available templates and defines
their associated category. When you create a new entry within the
templates xml file, make sure it is marked as “User” and not “System”.
This is because the system entries are internally defined, which means
that it is important that your additions be marked as user entries.
</li>
<li>Each format is then fully defined within a check format xml file
that must be stored within the appropriate category folder.</li>
<li>Finally, the associated images must be stored in folder: / images /.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You will need review these existing xml files and get a good
understanding of how check formats and their associated fields are
specified. You will need to use an editor and add your new formats and
fields to this xml definition. For each logical element within your
check image format, you will provide the font, x/y coordinates, and
length. Make sure you store this updated file in a safe location (where
it is backed up) since it may be updated when you install the next
X9Assist release. </li>
<li>Determine what fonts you want to use for the various fields that
will be drawn on top of your image format. You must also provide the
initial font size to be used for the drawing process. If the drawn text
will not fit within the available space, X9Assist will progressively
reduce the font size until the text will fit. However, there is a
performance impact when this resizing is required, so you will want to
ensure that your font and size will allow all text to be drawn within
the defined space. This process is simplified if your image design
allows sufficient space for all fields. </li>
<li>As a part of this process, you will need to document the x/y
coordinates and lengths of each of the fields for your new check format.
The coordinates and lengths must be defined in inches. Most paint tools
allow you to use the mouse and point at any pixel within the image and
get the x/y coordinates. For example, GIMP will display these
coordinates in either pixels, inches, or centimeters. This is a very
detailed step but easily accomplished when you use a tool that provides
the needed positional feedback. </li>
<li>Once your modifications are tested, always backup your modifications
to a zip file so you always have reference to these in case they are
replaced during a future release installation. </li>
</ul>
<p>If your custom check artwork is created by scanning your existing
internal items, you may have color images that need to be converted to
black and white before they can be used for Make / Generate. When this
is the case, you will need to convert your images from color (RGB) to
bi-tonal (black/white) images as required by standard image exchange.
This can be done using various image tools. Here is an example of how to
do this using GIMP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load your color image. </li>
<li>From the menu, select Colors / Components / Channel Mixer; check
monochrome, preserve luminosity, and save. </li>
<li>From the menu, select Colors / Brightness-Contrast, move the
brightness slider to the left and move the contrast slider to the right.
You may find that this is a repetitive process that you can continue to
do until you achieve the best possible black / white version of your
image. When OK when you are satisfied with the results. </li>
<li>From the menu, select Image / Mode / Indexed; select use black and
white (1 bit) palette and then use the convert button which will
translate your image from color to black / white. </li>
<li>From the menu, select File / Export As to write your transformed
image to an external file. The image file name that you enter in the box
at the top must have a valid image file extension which will determine
the image format to be used. Our suggestion is to export as PNG since it
is a lossless image format and is commonly used within the industry. You
should not select TIFF since your exported image will not have valid
TIFF tags per image exchange standards. </li>
</ul>
