<p>Modify provides facilities to make changes to individual records and
fields within the currently loaded file. Changes are made to an “in
memory” copy of the currently loaded file and will not be available to
other applications until you save your results to a new output file.
</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that you do not replace the current input
file (by saving with the same file name), but that you instead create a
new and unique file with your changes.  This is a best practice that
should be used whenever possible. </p>
<p>All file level validations will be run when you save a modified file
to a new replacement file. You should always look at the results and
attributes of the newly saved file very closely. This includes the
number of records, dollar totals, and validation results. </p>
<p>Modify Sessions</p>
<p>Modify is an advanced facility which includes the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change individual fields within as many record types as
desired.</li>
<li>Delete records using several techniques (individually, by group, by
record range, all good items, or all error items). </li>
</ul>
<p>A modify session can be enabled or disabled at any time. Note that
modifications to the currently loaded file are only allowed when a
modify session is actually enabled. This is a preventative measure that
requires that you first activate the modify facility before making
changes. </p>
<p>You can easily tell when a modify session is active. The background
color will change from the standard color (default is green) to an
alternate color (default is turquoise). You can also visually tell which
fields have been changed, since all modified fields will be highlighted
using an alternate color as well (default is to show in a light orange).
These colors can be changed through the program options panel based on
your specific preferences. </p>
<p>Modify includes a counter in the lower left corner of the dashboard
that indicates how many modifications have been made to the current
file. This counter provides a quick and easy mechanism to visually
determine the number of field changes that have been applied.</p>
<p>Modification Log </p>
<p>The modification log is a running list of all of the field level
changes which have been made to the in-memory copy of the current file.
The modification log includes information about each field which has
been modified, including the before and after values for each such
field. If a field has been modified more than once, then the
modification log will report the original value and the most recently
assigned value for the modified field.</p>
<p>The modification log can be used to jump to any record that has been
modified, allowing you to view the context of the change that has been
applied.</p>
<p>The modification log will also allow you to revert any single
modification. When a change is reverted, the original value will be
applied and the modification will be removed from the log, just like it
never happened.</p>
<p>Fields that can be Modified</p>
<p>The file specification (in xml) defines which fields can be modified.
Typical defaults are assigned that allow virtually all fields within all
record types to be modification. However, this facility can be
customized by your organization should you want to limit the ability to
apply certain modifications. This can be accomplished with an update to
the various xml rule files.</p>
<p>Audit Trail</p>
<p>The modify panel will always provide a list of all modifications that
have been made since your modification session was initiated. </p>
<p>Modify will track changes at the field level and will tell you if you
have changed a field more than once during your modify session. </p>
<p>A modify report can be generated at any time using the reports
facility (either PDF reports or the Excel Exporter). </p>
<p>The modification log can be written to an external file as a part of
the save process. Please refer to save for more information about this
facility. </p>
<p>Editing and Validation</p>
<p>When you enter a new value for a field, modify will apply all field
level edits and will ensure that the specific value that you enter is
acceptable. You will receive an error if the value is not appropriate
for this field. Modify will justify the new value automatically based on
the specification rules for the current field. </p>
<p>However, additional edits are required to cross check values against
all other records. For example, if you change a truncation indicator,
there are potential edits that will value this field against other
record types (for example, an edit that would indicate that only one
endorsement can have a truncation indicator of Y). You must rerun the
validation process to have these edits applied. You will be reminded of
this on the bottom of the DashBoard, where there will be count of how
many changes you have made since the last validation was performed. You
must run a validation prior to saving the file. </p>
<p>Modify Individual Record Fields</p>
<p>When you click the modify button for a given record, you are
presented with a new panel that allows you to modify all fields within
the current record within a single interaction. The modify record panel
uses the defined alternate background color to highlight the fields that
have been changed by earlier modifications applied during this user
session. </p>
<p>This panel includes various information for each field that can be
changed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field number</li>
<li>Field name</li>
<li>Current value</li>
<li>New value (this is the column where new values will be entered)
</li>
<li>Error message (when there are issues with the new value that you
have entered) </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this panel to change one or more fields within the
current record. You should pay very close attention to the “Error
Message” column to ensure that the new values that you enter are
acceptable per the edits that are identified for that particular
field.</p>
<p>Note that you do not need to be concerned with justification, since
positioning of the data that you enter will be automatically determined
and applied by the modify process. You only need to enter the new value.
Modify will apply all defined edits for the field being changed and will
return any errors that are identified. You must correct errors before
your new value will be accepted. </p>
<p>Overrides</p>
<p>There may be situations where you want to override the standard field
modification process to allow you to enter values that would otherwise
not be accepted. Overrides are provided in the upper left to allow you
to activate these override functions, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can apply an override to allow invalid values to be entered. You
would want to use this override when you are purposely creating invalid
data for capture and downstream application testing. You can do this by
selecting the override option which is at the top right of the modify
record panel. By enabling this override, you can force a new value to be
accepted by modify regardless of errors. </li>
<li>You can apply an override to allow lower case values to be entered.
Normally, all lower case values will be automatically translated to
upper case. By enabling this override, you can enter lowercase values
and they will be retained and assigned. </li>
<li>You can apply an override to allow leading and/or trailing blanks to
be retained as entered. The standard field modification process will
remove all leading and/or trailing blanks that you enter and will then
justify the field based on the validations rules that are defined for
each field. By enabling this override, you are turning off standard data
justification and blanks will be retained exactly as you have entered
them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Deleting Records and Record Groups</p>
<p>There are several delete strategies that are designed to simplify the
process of removing records from the current file. These are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete by record range. This technique can be used to easily delete
a single record or a group of records (eg, an item, a bundle, or an
entire cash letter). </li>
<li>Delete all records by record type within range. </li>
<li>Delete all records with a given record type. </li>
<li>Delete all good items within the file thus leaving all error items.
</li>
<li>Delete all error items within the file thus leaving all good items.
</li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting by record number range, you should begin by positioning
the viewer on the first record within the group that you want to delete.
After that positioning is set, you then indicate that you want to begin
the delete using the tools-delete function from the menu bar. </p>
<p>At that time, you will get the delete screen that is populated with
information about the delete you just initiated. You should closely
review this screen, including the record numbers, record types, and the
number of records that have been chosen to be deleted. Based on your
review, you can adjust the first and last record numbers within those
respective fields. </p>
<p>You can use delete by range to accomplish many goals. For example,
you can remove a single addendum record within an item. Or you can
create an invalid file by removing a batch/bundle trailer while leaving
the associated header and associated items. You can see the overall
power of this function. </p>
<p>You obviously need to pay close attention to this record selection
process. However, also be aware that you will have multiple levels of
canceling your request. The most important is that you can review the
change log (which will provide information on every delete you have
done) and then will have to ultimately save the file for the changes to
become effective.</p>
<p>Records can be deleted by record type. This is helpful in situations
where you want to remove all records with the same record type (eg, you
want to remove all addenda). This would be extremely difficult if you
attempted to delete the records one at a time. You can alternatively use
this facility to quickly delete all records by type in a single
operation. </p>
<p>Finally, there is the ability to delete records based on their error
status. You can also delete all error items (those marked with errors or
warnings), or alternatively all items without errors (the good items).
For example, this technique is commonly used to remove all good items
from the current file and thus get a new file that contains only the
error items so they can be more closely reviewed. In support of this
capability, Delete also allows you to optionally remove all resulting
empty bundles and/or cash letters from the file. </p>
<p>Delete Confirmation</p>
<p>Once you have reviewed your delete request and wish to proceed, you
will next press the Delete button. When you do the delete, you will get
a pop-up that must be approved for the delete to continue. Once deleted,
you can then watch the modify log which will track all modifies and
deletes that you perform during your session. You can also use the
modify log to revert any individual changes that you have made. </p>
