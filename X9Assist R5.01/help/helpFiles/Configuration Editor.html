<p>The Configuration Editor is used to define the various x9
configurations that can be used for x9 file validations. Each
configuration is a logical group of rule files that, when collectively
taken as a group, define the validations that will be applied against an
x9 file. </p>
<p>X9Assist is installed with a predefined list of configurations. List
standard list can then be changed using the Configuration Editor based
on your specific requirements. This is especially important when you are
adding your own x9 rule definitions and hence must construct a
configuration to utilize your custom x9 rules. Every configuration
consists of the following attributes: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Attributes</td>
<td>Attribute Content and Purpose</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>X9 rules file</td>
<td>Contains a list of the rules that are applied to the x9 records and
fields within the x9 file. These rules are used to generate x9 related
errors. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Tiff rules file</td>
<td>Contains a list of the rules that are applied to the tiff images
within the x9 file. These rules are used to generate image related
errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Messages file</td>
<td>Contains a list of the error messages and their associated severity
levels. These rules are used to assign the severity level of the errors
that are generated during the validation process. Each error has an
assigned severity level of Error, Warn, Info, or OK. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Entry Type</td>
<td>Defines the configuration as either “System” or “User”. System
entries are automatically defined within the X9Assist environment and
cannot be modified by the user. User entries can be created using the
Configuration Editor and will be automatically retained across user
sessions and X9Assist release installations. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each configuration is displayed with a “status” column, which
provides the current validation status of the components with that
configuration. If the configuration is displayed with a check mark, then
all of the components within that configuration are present and
validated.</p>
<p>Entries can be deleted by selecting them (via their check box) and
then pressing the delete button. System entries cannot be deleted. </p>
<p>This table must be saved for your changes to be effective. Results
will be saved to xml/config.xml.</p>
<p>System Entries versus User Entries</p>
<p>A system entry is one which is created internally and added to this
table. The content of system entries may change from release to release.
The editor will allow user entries to be modified or deleted, while
system entries are not allowed to be changed.</p>
<p>Load Identifiers</p>
<p>The Configuration Editor load identifier column provides information
as to the location and time stamp for each physical component. The
location can be in one of three places:</p>
<ul>
<li>The launch folder (where X9Assist was loaded from) is identified as
“L”.</li>
<li>The home folder (within user documents) is identified as “H”.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the load identifier can be blank, which indicates that
the component was not found in either of these two locations but instead
defaulted to the internal resources definition that is defined within
the SDK itself. This is not a typical configuration for X9Assist, since
our rules are distributed with that product and are installed in the
launch folder. </li>
</ul>
<p>By convention, all rules should be stored in the launch folder (they
should not be placed in the home folder). This is because rule parsing
is dependent on the associated code that is implemented within the
current release. Locating rules in the home folder would potentially
make them available to more than one release of X9Assist, which would
result in unpredictable results and most probably program aborts. </p>
<p>Construction of the Configuration List</p>
<p>X9Assist loads the internal configuration list during session
initialization as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All system entries are internally populated to the configuration
list based on the current release definitions. When you install a new
X9Assist release, this may result in a new configuration list entry
being automatically added, or it may alternatively result in an obsolete
entry being removed.</li>
<li>All user entries are then automatically merged from the config.xml
definition. Only user entries are added during this merge process.
System entries are not needed since they are already been populated. If
you need to modify a system entry, then you should create a user entry
with the same name, which will then overlay the system entry with that
same name. </li>
</ul>
<p>Default Session Configuration</p>
<p>The configuration editor allows assignment of the default session
configuration. When this configuration has been set, it will override
the standard use of our auto-detection process and instead will be used
for validation whenever a new file is opened. Other configurations can
still be made available for use, but they must be invoked manually from
the tool bar. </p>
<p>Standard Configurations</p>
<p>X9Assist and the X9Ware SDK support the following x9.37 industry
specifications: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DSTU</td>
<td>Introduced in 2003 as part of the Check Clearing for the 21st
Century Act, the DSTU is the original and most commonly used image
exchange standard which establishes the basis for U.S. check image
exchange between two financial institutions. The DSTU continues to be
widely used since it is the most basic of standards and it generally
accepted throughout the industry. X9Ware fully supports the X9.37 DSTU
standard. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>X9.100-187</td>
<td>X9.100-187 was introduced in 2008 as an updated replacement for the
DSTU. It is used as the basis of the specifications that have been
adopted by many financial institutions as a DSTU replacement, and
clarifies many of the gaps that existed within the original standard.
X9.100-187 standard was updated in 2013 and 2016. Each of the X9.100-187
standards has an associated Universal Companion Document (UCD) which is
an extension that contains commonly accepted by financial institutions
and third party processors. X9Ware provides support for X9.100-187-2008,
X9.100-187-2013, X9.100-187-2016, X9.100-187-2008-UCD,
X9.100-187-2013-UCD, and X9.100-187-2018-UCD. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>X9.100-180</td>
<td>X9.100-180 was published in 2006 with the intention to address many
of the business requirements that were identified with the DSTU. The
biggest desirable change was the ability to support credits, along with
separate debit and credit totals in trailer records. Unfortunately, the
various record types and fields within X9.100-180 became so different
from the DSTU that adoption of this standard became extremely difficult.
The X9.100-187 UCD was the industry response to X9.100-180, allowing
specific needs to be addressed in more straight forward ways. As a
result, X9.100-180 is largely unused by most financial institutions.
X9Ware provides support for X9.100-180-2006 and X9.100-180-2016. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CPA 015</td>
<td>Canadian Payments Association Standard 015 (CPA 015) is an extension
to X9.100-187 and defines how image exchange has been implemented within
Canada. This standard addresses currency requirements in support of CAD
and USD and supports cross border exchange between banks. X9Ware
provides full support for the CPA-015 standard. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cross Border</td>
<td>X9Ware has implemented various extensions to the X9.100-187
standards in support of cross border exchange. These extensions are
limited to accepting routing numbers in a variety of formats including
4-4 and 5-3 as required by Canadian financial institutions. </td>

<p>Configuration Names</p>
<p>Configuration names are used internally to identify the standard
level. This is a basic requirement must be taken into consideration as
you assign names to user defined configuration. This is accomplished
through identification strings that must be embedded within the
configuration name, as identified by this table:</p>
