<p>The Registration panel is used to enter and subsequently review
product authorizations. </p>
<p>Our issued license keys are in one of two formats. </p>
<ul>
<li>First is a 19-character license key that is provided through an
email transmittal, as part of our invoicing and license key issuance
process. These license keys are internally validated using a proprietary
encoding scheme and will not require internet access. </li>
<li>Second is a 32-character license key that is obtained from an online
purchase. These license keys will be validated using an online
registration process to our website, which will require internet access.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two license key formats are readily identifiable due to their
different layouts. You can visually inspect your specific license key
and readily determine which format has been issued to you. The
19-character license keys are formatted as xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx with the
embedded dashes. We have separate entry and validation procedures for
these two formats. </p>
<p>The 19-character license key are referred to as “offline” license
keys and are formatted as xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx). These keys are
distributed within an email (transmittal) which is provided after your
payment is either completed or confirmed as in progress. All fields
(product type, customer name, company name, expiration date, and license
key) are validated together as a group. After you enter the required
information, you then use the register button (at the bottom of the
panel) to initiate the registration process. An error in any of these
fields will result in a mismatch and will thus require that you closely
review and enter the information again (after the needed corrections are
made). It is often easier to use copy and paste this information from
your transmittal directly into the form, which will ensure that there
are no typos or transcription errors.</p>
<p>The 32-character license keys are referred to as “online” license
keys and will be registered through our website. These license keys are
sent to you after an online product product from our website. As part of
this registration, you will enter the product type and the license key
as a functional pair, which must agree with your online purchase. After
you enter the required information, you then use the register button (at
the bottom of the panel) to initiate the registration process. It is
often easier to copy and paste the license key into the form, which will
ensure that there are no typos or transcription errors.</p>
<p>Online license keys will have to be manually entered as part of
registration. Offline license keys do not need to be entered, because we
distribute a copy of your license file that can be imported using the
registration panel. If you have an off line key, then using import is
much easier since it eliminates the potential for data entry errors.
</p>
<p>If you must enter your license key information, please do so
carefully. Note that you can cut and paste several of these fields
(including the license key) from our transmittal which means that you do
not have to re-enter this information. This can reduce the potential for
input errors. </p>
<p>The following buttons appear on the main registration panel and are
used to launch a tailored process for your product registration:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Import license</td>
<td>Import a new license from an external file (for example, a new
license that was provided to you as an email attachment). X9Ware LLC
distributes these license files as part of offline purchases (not
through our website). These are very small encrypted TXT files that
include your specific licensing information. By importing this file, you
eliminate the more tedious task of manually enter your license key.
These license key files are distributed using a structured name which is
formatted as:
elicense_[company]_[product]_expires_[expirationDate].txt.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Enter 19-character license key</td>
<td>Enter a 19-character license key (these are formatted as
xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx) which would be received via an email transmittal,
either from X9Ware LLC or perhaps shared with you by someone else within
your organization. These keys are associated with what we refer to as an
offline purchase, which means that the purchase was through a direct
invoicing process (the purchase was not made online from our website).
This license key will be authorized locally and will not require
internet access.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Enter 32-character license key</td>
<td>Enter a 32-character license key that you received from an online
purchase or renewal via our website. You will be able to copy and paste
the key (you will not have to re-enter it). Please be aware that the
license key will be validated using a real-time confirmation to our
website, so internet access is required to complete this registration
process.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Export license</td>
<td>Export your current license key to an external file that you then
share with others within your organization. This exported license can be
distributed as an email attachment for subsequent import.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The following button actions are available at the bottom of the
online and offline popup panels: </p>
<ul>
<li>Register – is used to initiate registration process.</li>
<li>Clear – is used as a reset function that will clear any text fields
that have been entered. </li>
<li>Cancel – is used to exit the registration panel. </li>
</ul>
<p>After the license key has been successfully entered or imported, an
elicense.txt file is updated within folder / documents / x9_assist /
license /. This file is updated only as part of this registration
process and will otherwise remain unchanged. The elicense.txt file is in
an encrypted format, such that it cannot be viewed or modified. You can
confirm that the elicense.txt file has been updated during the
registration process using the associated date-time stamp that displayed
by File Explorer.</p>
<p>Subject to your license level, the elicense.txt file can be shared
with others within your organization. This is done by sending it to them
(as an email attachment, etc) and having them drop it into the
/documents/x9_assist/license/ folder on their respective workstation.
This is then a replacement of their default or expiring license file,
and will automatically bring their credentials current without having to
know the license key or go through the license key entry process. </p>
<p>The elicense.txt file is unique to your company, so it should be
handled accordingly and only shared within your organization, and then
only within the limits of your license. For example, if you have a
single seat license, you should not share your license with others,
since they must obtain a unqiue and separate license for their
workstation. You obviously need to ensure that your license is not
shared outside of your organization. We have attempted to make our
licensing process as painless as possible. Your cooperation and
compliance is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Our licenses are issued for a duration of one or more years. You can
purchase a multi-year license to eliminate expiration date issues. Our
applications provide informational messages on any upcoming license
expirations within sixty (60) days in advance of an upcoming expiration
date. </p>
<p>Licensing requests can be made via email to <a
href="mailto:x9assist@x9ware.com"><em><em>x9assist@x9ware.com</em></em></a>.
