Save As will allow you to specific the attributes of the output x9 file,
which can be different than the input x9 file. For example, the input x9
file could be Ascii without field zero lengths, and the created x9 file
could alternatively be Ebcdic with field zero lengths. </td>

previous find criteria is initially displayed so you can easily adjust
that criteria to begin your next search. You can create a filter to
allow you to easily browse your selection results and then use the
selected records for such further activities as creating a new x9 file

compatible spreadsheet program such as Open Office. You will first
select which of the available tables should be exported. An XLS workbook
will then be created that contains the selected tables, where each table
will be a separate sheet within the workbook. The XLS spreadsheet is
created in the /temp/reports folder. Each new workbook is created with a
uniquely defined name through a date and time suffix that is appended to
the file name. You can perform various functions with the generated XLS
file once it is created. For example, you can print it, share it with
others, or save it for future reference. The retention period (in days)
for reports is a program option and can be modified based on your
requirements. Spreadsheets created in the reports folder will be
automatically deleted when this number of retention days is
exceeded.</td>

file is created in the /temp/reports folder. Each new print file is
created with a uniquely defined name through a date and time suffix that
is appended to the file name. You can perform various functions with the
generated PDF once it has been created. For example, you can print it,

<td>Scrub the file to remove all proprietary information. The types of
proprietary information that will be removed is selectable as part of
the scrub operation. This function is very helpful to allow you to
create and then ultimately save a new x9 file that is based on this x9
file but has customer or operational information removed based on
confidentiality requirements. For example, you can use scrub to create a

Modification includes the ability to modify individual fields, delete
certain x9 record types, and replace images with missing image
documents. Modify allows you to review a list of your field changes and
then easily jump to any record that has been changed. Modify also
provides a facility to revert any individual change that has bee made.

<td>Generate is used to dynamically create X9 files from your
specifications. Generate will dynamically create images to match your x9
items. Generate also wraps all of the generated items with the control

many confidentiality issues associated with the use of production files
in your test environments. </td>

x9 files into a single (larger) x9 file. This is helpful to combine
various x9 files with different test cases into a single file that can
be used for ongoing testing, or to combine various x9 files to create a
single larger file, possibly to be used for stress testing purposes.

<td>Image MisMatch allows you to create checks where the front images
are mismatched with the associated MICR line data (either ICL type 25 or
ICLR type 31). This is a helpful process when you require image mismatch
files for your downstream application testing. </td>

<td></td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Duplicate Items Detector</td>
<td></td>
<td>The Duplicate Items Detector can identify duplicate items either
within the current x9 file, or across multiple x9 files. Duplicates can
be identified for the following types of items: check detail records
(type 25), return detail records (type 31), and credit reconciliation
records (type 61). Duplicates are considered within record type, which
means (for example) that you cannot have a duplicate that consists of a
debit and a credit, even if they have the same MICR line and
amount.</td>

<td>Mapping Editor</td>

<td>The Mapping Editor allows you review and update your mapping rules,
which are used to dynamically “bind” to configuration rules based on
contents of the x9 file header. This process allows the correct rules to
be applied to the file on an automated basis without manual
intervention. For example, you can use the bind process to define those
exchange partners who provide x9.100-187 files versus those who provide
x9.37 files, when fields in the x9 file header are not assigned properly
to allow that detection to be done based on the file alone. X9Assist is
then able to apply the appropriate validation rules based on the
originator. </td>

<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Configuration Editor</td>
<td></td>
<td>The Configuration Editor allows you to define logical configurations
that are used for x9 and tiff validation. Each configuration consists of
a x9 rules file, a tiff rules file, an application options file, and an
error message severities file. Each of these is an xml file which
controls part of the file validation process. A combination of these
four files can then be defined as a logical configuration and given a
name which is used by the Mapping Editor for x9 file binding. </td>

<td>ABA Editor</td>

<td>The ABA Editor is an optional facility exists to define your
upstream and downstream partners by their ABA. You can then indicate if
their role (upstream, downstream, both) and their status (start date,
end date, etc). This allows X9Assist to validate the origination and
destination ABA’s that exist in the file header. This ABA file can be
keyed or extracted from your image exchange application. </td>

<tr class="even">
<td>ABA List Editor</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>ModCheck Editor</td>

aba, account number, process control, and AUX OnUs fields which are all
required by the MICR line. </td>

<td>Program Options are used to display and optionally make changes to
the default settings. You can update the current program options or
create a new options file. All option files must be maintained within
