<p>The CSV Editor allows the content of a comma separated value (CSV)
file to be edited and saved. The editor includes many commonly used
tools, which simplifies the task of modifying a CSV file. Most
importantly, it allows CSV files that have a variable number of columns
to be edited without converting the file to a fixed column format. </p>
<p><strong>Other CSV Editors</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most CSV editors will save a CSV file in a fixed
column format, based on the maximum number of rows that are found across
the entire file. Although that makes sense for most CSV file usage
(especially those that are compliant with RFC4180 which defines a fixed
column standard), it does not apply to our CSV usage for X9.37 and ACH
files, each of which require a specific number of fields (cells) on each
row based on record type. Support for this variable column format is
core to our CSV Editor, where trailing non-populated fields on a given
row will be gray when they are not present. Editing a variable column
CSV file with most other editors may destroy their content, due to the
empty fields that might be appended to shorter rows. </p>
<p>Other CSV editors can have various annoying features. For example,
MS-Excel often converts numeric values into floating point (“E”) format.
MS-Excel also uses unusual and unexpected techniques when adding quote
marks around cell values. CSV files saved using MS-Excel are often times
unusable. The best CSV Editor we have found is actually LibreOffice,
which is quote mark friendly, but still converts files from variable
columns to fixed columns. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that our CSV Editor resolves all of these issues
by behaving in a manner that is compatible with our CSV file
requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Editor Highlights</strong> </p>
<p>The CSV editor is a high function tool, since it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Supports a variable number of columns on each row. </li>
<li>Columns are identified using both column numbers and Excel
identifiers. </li>
<li>Implements common row and copy operations.</li>
<li>Uses extensive highlighting to provide feedback on rows and columns
being edited. </li>
<li>Provides search capabilities to quickly find values within a file.
</li>
<li>Tracks modifications that have been made to the file since it was
initially loaded.</li>
<li>Includes the ability to revert any given row back to it’s initial
value. </li>
<li>Allows files to be saved under their current name or an alternate
name. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trailing-Truncated Fields </p>
<p>Each row within the editor can have a variable number of fields. The
number of columns presented by the editor is based on the maximum number
of columns found across all input rows. </p>
<p>If a row has trailing fields that are physically omitted from that
particular row, then those cells will be grayed-out to indicate that
they are not present to indicate they are truncated. These cells are not
written when the file is saved. </p>
<p>A trailing field can be marked as truncated (not present) in one of
several ways. First by selecting that row using the check box on the
left, and then using the truncate command to mark all trailing fields as
omitted. This can also be done for a single trailing field by entering a
value of ‘/ into that cell. When ‘/ is entered, that cell is marked as
truncated and will now be grayed out in the editor. The visual use of
the grayed-out cells makes it easy to identify these fields. </p>
<p>Trailing fields on a given line can be changed to empty strings using
the pad command, which is essentially the opposite of truncate. </p>
<p>A file can be converted from variable columns to fixed columns using
the select function (which can be used to select all) and then using the
pad command to pad all selected rows. This function should be used
carefully, since the concept of variable rows will be lost for this CSV
file. </p>
<p>Paste Board</p>
<p>The editor includes a “paste board” which can hold one or more rows
or a single column. We refer to this component as the paste board since
we do not want it confused with the operating system based clip board;
these are entirely different entities.</p>
<p>Any operation that stores data into the paste board will overlay the
previous content. The status line (at the bottom of the editor) always
informs you as to the current content of the paste board. Highlighters
are also included to visually show the data that has been copied into
the paste board.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting Rows</strong> </p>
<p>Rows are selected as input into our various row oriented command that
are available on the status line (at the bottom of the editor). Rows can
be selected in one of several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column one check boxes (on the left side of the editor) is used to
select one or more lines. Selected lines will be highlighted as they are
selected. </li>
<li>A block of rows can be selected by using the check box to select the
first and last rows, and then hitting the select button on the status
line to select the range. The selected block will then be highlighted.
</li>
<li>The reset button can be used to change all rows/columns to a
non-selected status. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selecting Columns</strong></p>
<p>Columns are selected using the radio buttons that are present at the
top of each column. Columns are selected as input to the various column
oriented commands (insert, delete, copy, etc) Only one column can be
selected at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Editor Commands</strong> </p>
<p>The following editor commands exist on the status line, at the bottom
editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert – is used to insert a new row or new column after the
selection. </li>
<li>Delete – is used to delete the selected rows or column. </li>
<li>Copy – is used to copy the selected rows or column into the paste
board. </li>
<li>Cut – is used to cut the selected rows or column and store them into
the paste board. Those rows will be deleted as part of this operation.
</li>
<li>Paste – is used to paste the content of the rows or column that
currently exist in the paste board, after the currently selected row or
column. The paste board will be cleared. </li>
<li>Truncate – is used to mark the trailing fields on the selected rows
or column as omitted (not physically present). These cells will become
gray and will not be written when saved. </li>
<li>Pad – is used to pad the selected rows to the maximum number for
this CSV file by setting those cells to the empty string. </li>
<li>Revert – is used to revert the selected rows or column to their
original values, at the time that the file was first loaded. </li>
<li>Select – is used to select multiple rows. A block of rows can be
selected by first selecting the first row in the block, then selecting
the last row in the block, and finally using the select button on the
status line to select the entire block. A column can be selected using
the radio button at the top of the column. Highlighting is used to
provide visual feedback on the result of the selection and confirmation
that it was done as expected. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Saving a File</strong> </p>
<p>A modification count is always provided on the status line, in the
lower left corner of the editor. This is a count of the number of rows
that have been modified.</p>
<p>Save is initiated using the button provided on the status line. A
file chooser will be presented allowing the output file to be chosen.
Once confirmed, the file is saved and then reloaded into the editor
which confirms that the contents are as expected. </p>
<p>Search / Replace </p>
<p>The CSV Editor includes a find function, but does not include a text
based search/replace tool. However, you can use typically other more
generic text tools (eg, NotePad or NotePad++) when this is needed. These
tools have very powerful search/replace capabilities. Because of that,
our thought has been that it is not needed in our editor at this time.
</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Files Using Import/Export</strong> </p>
<p>The CSV Editor can be used in conjunction with our Import/Export
tools as a powerful combination which allows files to be modified in a
large number of ways. This is accomplished through the following basic
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export the file (either X9.37 or ACH) to CSV. </li>
<li>Use the CSV Editor to make changes, which can be such things as
remove records, rearrange records using cut/paste, etc. </li>
<li>Import the modified CSV file.</li>
<li>Perhaps use Repair based on the final status and the modifications
which have been made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these tools is especially useful when data is
needed for negative testing, where invalid record sequences are needed
for specific use cases. This can be fully accomplished using the CSV
Editor in a very straight forward manner. </p>
