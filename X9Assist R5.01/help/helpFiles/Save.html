<p>Save is used to create a new output file from the currently loaded
file. Save is most typically used after modifications have been applied.
The save process allows you to specify the attributes of the new file to
be created. This consists of setting the character set (EBCDIC or ASCII)
and, for X9 Files, an indication of whether field zero lengths are to be
included or excluded. </p>
<p>Save will inform you if the current file has validation errors, or if
there have been modifications made to the file that have not yet been
validated. These messages are informational. The recommendation is that
you always correct errors before you save, and that you run Validate to
be aware of the current validation status and that all desired errors
have been corrected. </p>
<p>X9 files are normally written with standard attributes, which are
EBCDIC and inclusion of field zero lengths. You should understand and
consider the implications of not setting these attributes. Save will
prompt you if you have decided to override these standards. </p>
<p>Once the desired file attributes have been selected, you then press
Save and you will then select you the location and name of the output
file that is being created. </p>
<p>Audit Trail</p>
<p>Save is fully integrated with the Modify process that tracks all
modifications that have been made to the currently loaded file. Save
informs you of the number of modifications that have been made, and
allows you to optionally create and export the modification log as an
audit trail for future reference. You can also optionally view the
modification log after it has been created. Your options to both create
the modification log and to view it will be recorded in user
preferences, and then applied in future sessions. </p>
<p>Save has an optional property setting (within the X9Ware properties
file) that allows you to specify the name of the modification log folder
that is used on a mandatory basis within your organization. This is a
configuration setting that is defined as part of your installation and
cannot be altered or disabled. When the modification log property has
been enabled within your environment, all modification logs are placed
in that defined folder. Creation of the modification log will be done
automatically for you as an audit trail. In this situation, you will not
be prompted regarding the creation of the modification log. You still
have the option to review the modification log after your save as been
completed. </p>
<p>Output File Selection</p>
<p>Save will suggest a new file name that is created from the originally
loaded file name. You can alternatively decide to overwrite the original
(input) file, but that practice is NOT recommended since it will destroy
the original input file. When you do indicate that the input file should
be overwritten, the save process will suggest that a backup be created
of your original file as part of the save operation. Creation of this
backup file is not mandatory but is highly recommended as part of your
best practices. </p>
<p>Validation After Save </p>
<p>Validation will be automatically run against the saved file and it
will then be loaded into the viewer. You should closely review the
attributes and characteristics of the saved file. This includes the
record count, dollar amount totals, and the validation status in terms
of field level errors. These results should be logically compared
against your original input file to ensure that all is as expected. </p>
