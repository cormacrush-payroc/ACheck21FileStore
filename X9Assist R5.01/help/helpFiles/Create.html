<p>Create can be used to create a new file using one or items from the
currently loaded file, typically from a list of filtered items. Input to
this process can be either a filter that contains the specific items to
be included in the new file, or alternatively the entire content of the
current file. Filters may be created using the PickList, Find, Search,
and Error Summary functions. </p>
<p>A common use of this tool is to use PickList to select individual
items from the currently loaded file and to then create a new file
directly from those specific items. In addition to manually selecting
items, the system generated filters can be used to build files as well.
For example, you can validate a file and then use the Error Summary tab
to create a filter of just those items that have a specific error. You
can then create an output file that consists solely of those items. </p>
<p>For x9, the output file can be either ICL (forward presentment) or
ICLR (returns). What is particularly useful is that Create can be used
to transform an ICL file to ICLR and similarly transform an ICLR file
back to ICL. These conversions are especially helpful during various
on-boarding and system testing scenarios. </p>
<p>You can create the new file directly from the selected items or you
can instead route the items through the Generate function. If you create
the file on a direct basis, then the selected items will be written
exactly as they appear within the current file (including the attached
addenda and image records) and will be written in their current format
(ICL or ICLR). Items will remain within their current file and bundle
structure. Repackage can be used to further consolidate the bundles when
that is specifically desired. </p>
<p>You can alternatively create the new file through the Generate
function. When this option is selected, the items will be reformatted
from into CSV and then routed into Generate for additional reformatting.
When using this approach, the attributes and reformatting of these items
is then completely controlled by a Generate Configuration which is user
defined and can be saved for repetitive reuse. </p>
<p>For x9, when using Generate you can transform items from ICL to ICLR
or from ICLR to ICL. You also have complete control of the file header,
cash control header, and bundling of these items. </p>
<p>Input Source</p>
<p>Input items are taken from the currently loaded file. When creating
the output file using Generate, you can select the input source as
either the entire file (all items) or only those items that are
associated with a defined filter. </p>
<p>X9 File Creation Method</p>
<p>Generate From Filter requires that you select the method that will be
used to create the new x9 file. One of two selections must be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a new file directly from the existing record data. Records
are written in the existing format and the data is not modified in any
manner. </li>
<li>Reformat and process through Generate. When this option is selected,
the Generate button will take you to the Generate panel, where you can
review and modify your generate parameters before you initiate the file
generation process. You can also use this interface to specify and save
a customized generator that can be repetitively reused in future user
sessions. When used in this manner, you can quickly do functions such
as: </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Use an ICL to create an ICL with different file headers</li>
<li>Use an ICL to create an ICLR with the same items and possibly
different headers </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Routing Items through Generate</p>
<p>When items are routed through Generate, the File Control header, Cash
Letter header, and Item Addenda records are normally retained when using
this tool. However, options are provided to drop these record types on
the CSV that is sent to Generate to provide additional flexibility by
allowing Generate to take full control of those record types. These
options would typically be used in a testing environment to meet
specific data needs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating the header records within the intermediate CSV file,
allowing data on the File Control, Cash Letter, and Dates tabs within
Generate to create those record types. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating the addendum records within the intermediate CSV file,
allowing the Addenda tab within Generate to alternatively create those
record types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mixed Debit-Credit Files </p>
<p>Create allows both debits and credits to be selected. The processing
varies a bit by dialect:</p>
<ul>
<li>X9 files typically consist of checks which might be offset by a
single credit. In this scenario, the credit can either be positioned
before or after the debits, by most typically appears first. When using
the PickList, Create allows you to optionally select this credit, to be
included in the output file. Create will then ask you if the credit
should be modified to match the debit total of the selected items. </li>
<li>ACH and CPA005 files more typically consist of both debits and
credits. In some situations, a file may consist of debits offset by a
single credit, or credits offset by a single debit. In this case, Create
recognizes that there is a single offset transaction and will ask if the
amount on that balancing item should be modified. </li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Create is a powerful tool that can be used to create new files from
specific items of your selection. Using the interface to Generate, you
can also customize the file header information and other parameters
associated with the newly created file. These parameters can be saved in
a generator that can be referenced and invoked in future user sessions.
