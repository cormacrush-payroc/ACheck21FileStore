<p>Add IRD is a detailed function that allows individual IRDs to be
decisioned with a user supplied return reason. Add IRD allows items
(either individually or in bulk) to be added to a user constructed pick
list which can then be subsequently reviewed and printed. The Add IRD
function is typically used as a mechanism to print a selected number of
items from an ICL. These printed IRDs can represent forward presentment
or returned items. For returns, the dialog allows separate return
reasons to be specified on an item by item basis. User selected items
are added to a filter list which is our general purpose facility which
describe a subset of items within the current x9 file. </p>
<p>IRD Types</p>
<p>IRD items are entered as one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>An IRD Substitute is a negotiable instrument used to represent the
digital reproduction of an original paper check. Substitute checks are
recognized as legal checks as long as the instruments meet specific
requirements. These requirements include the faithful reproduction of
the paper check and warranty of the instrument by the "reconverting
bank"—the financial institution that created the substitute check or the
first financial institution that transferred or presented it during the
check clearing process. Substitute checks are also subject to the UCC,
existing federal and state check laws, and regulations specific to
consumer rights that affect the acceptance of these instruments.
Although a substitute check is subject to the UCC and existing state and
federal check laws, the Check 21 Act takes precedence over these other
laws and regulations for this instrument. </li>
<li>An IRD Return represents an item that was not paid by the issuing
bank for some defined return reason (eg, insufficient funds). In this
situation, the paying bank stamps the item as NSF (non-sufficient funds)
which identifies the reason for the return. When an item is being
returned, a “5" will be placed in the MICR line EPC field to identify
the substitute check according to ANS X9.90, along with the routing
number of the depository financial institution and the dollar amount of
the substitute check. The paying bank returns the unpaid returned item
through the routing process to the BOFD for exception handling, which
would typically include debiting the customer for the returned item,
sending a charge back notice to its customer (either electronically or
through the mail), and most probably assessing a fee which is associated
with the returned item process. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adding Items to the IRD List</p>
<p>Items within the IRD List filter are constructed using a series of
interactions. The ICL viewer tree (on the left) is used to identify the
items to be added to the list. This can be done in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Items can be added one at a time. This is done by selecting the item
in the viewer tree and then invoking Add IRD from the tool bar. </li>
<li>Multiple items can be added in a single interaction. This is done by
holding done the CTRL key, selecting the items to be added using the
mouse, and then invoking Add IRD from the tool bar. </li>
<li>A block of items can be added in a single interaction. This is done
by selecting the first item within the block, holding done the
CTRL/SHIFT keys and selecting the last item within the block, and then
invoking Add IRD from the tool bar. </li>
<li>An entire bundle of items can be selected in a single interaction.
This is done by selecting the bundle and then invoking Add IRD from the
tool bar. </li>
<li>An entire cash letter of items can be selected in a single
interaction. This is done by selecting the bundle and then invoking Add
IRD from the tool bar. </li>
<li>An entire file of items can be selected in a single interaction.
This is done by selecting the bundle and then invoking Add IRD from the
tool bar. </li>
</ul>
<p>The selection process can be used repeatedly to build the IRD List
with the desired items, which will be displayed in a system filter.
Items can continue to be both added or removed from the list as
necessary. Items can also be reviewed and launched using the filter
list. Once the content of an IRD List has been confirmed, the list can
then be used as input to Print Image. </p>
<p>Entering IRD Information for Individual Items</p>
<p>The Add IRD panel allows you to enter information that is associated
with each IRD within the overall list. The following fields must be
entered for each IRD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creator routing number – which identifies the financial institution
that is creating this image return document. </li>
<li>Business date – the date that the IRD is printed. </li>
<li>Item sequence number – the item sequence number that is associated
with the IRD. </li>
<li>Return reason – the return reason (for returned items). </li>
</ul>
<p>Items are typically decisioned one at a time, which allows the
appropriate return reason to be assigned to each item. As an
alternative, items can be processed in a grouped (repetitive) manner,
which is appropriate when the same return reason applies to all items,
and the default action of an incremented item sequence number is
acceptable. </p>
<p>The number of remaining items to be decisioned will always displayed
on the action line in the lower left corner. Buttons on the action panel
are used to either apply (add) or apply all items to the accumulated IRD
print list. The process continues for all remaining items within the
list. </p>
<p>Once all selected items have been decision, the entry process will be
terminated and the resulting IRD List will be displayed. You can use the
filter tab to launch to any given item or alternatively remove items
that were added in error. Also note that the return reason is displayed
for each item within the filter list, which allow you to review the
assigned returned reasons for all items. </p>
<p>Using the IRD List to Print Item Images </p>
<p>Once the IRD List has been finalized and confirmed, it is then used
as a filter for other application functions including Print Images. </p>
<p>Print Image supports various page layouts, and very specifically
supports 3x1 IRD format which is used to print IRD documents. In
addition to standard layouts, Print Image allows custom formats to be
defined when your page (paper) layout varies from our standard format.
</p>
<p>When printing images, our “<strong>Letter 3 x 1 IRD Print</strong>”
format should be applicable for most user environments. This print
format can be adjusted based on your check template and specific printer
environment. Contact us if you need assistance to implement your
specific check layout. The important attributes of this image print
format are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Letter. </li>
<li>3x1 format.</li>
<li>Front and back images.</li>
<li>Two sided printing (front images on even pages and back images on
odd pages).</li>
<li>Collated which retains the item order after printing and bursting.
</li>
<li>1200 DPI to improve document quality – should be set which will
trigger the print image function to use 1200 dpi whenever possible.
</li>
<li>Redraw MICR from x9 data – should be specified since it allows the
MICR line to be drawn on the IRD using the E13B font. </li>
<li>Return MICR 8 digit routings in xxxx-xxxx format – should be
specified to insert the dash into the routing field when an eight digit
routing is present. </li>
</ul>
