<p>Convert X9 to ACH is used to create a new ACH file from the currently
loaded x9 file. A user selected standard entry class is used to build
the new ACH file. This includes the various entry classes that represent
checks (ARC, BOC, POP, RCK, TRC, and XCK) as well as some more generic
entry classes which may provide utility within the user environment (CCD
and PPD).</p>
<p>Conversion Overview</p>
<p>Convert is a generalized conversion tool that can be used to
translate from one file format to another. X9Ware is in a unique
position to implement this functionality given our support for both the
X9 and ACH file formats. This allows the user to load an x9 file, browse
that file to ensure the content is correct, possibly modify the content
of that file if needed (for example, remove records), and then use those
results to create an ACH file. All of this is done within the same tools
and using using a consistent user interface.</p>
<p>The following fields must be entered for the X9 to ACH
conversion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debit transaction code: defines the transaction code to be assigned
to debits. </li>
<li>Credit transaction code: defines the transaction code to be assigned
to credits. </li>
<li>Identification number: defines data that is assigned to ACH field
6.7. This value will be automatically assigned from the check serial
number for standard entry classes of ARC, BOC, POP, and RCK. Other entry
classes allow you to explicitly assign the value to be used. When a
value is not entered and has no default, it will otherwise be assigned
from the check serial number. </li>
<li>Receiver information: defines data that is assigned to ACH field
6.8. This value will be automatically assigned from the process control
field and the item sequence number for standard entry classes of TRC and
XCK. Other entry classes allow you to explicitly assign the value to be
used. When a value is not entered and has no default, it will otherwise
be assigned from the trc/xck process control and item sequence number
format. </li>
<li>Discretionary data: is an optional two character field that is
assigned to ACH field 6.9. </li>
<li>Starting sequence number: is a seven (7) digit number that is used
to sequentially assign the trace number for the created items, which is
populated into ACH field 6.11. The overall trace number is 15 digits and
consists of the 8 digit ODFI routing number which is suffixed by this
sequence number. On a default basis, this starting sequence number is
“DD00000” where DD is a variation taken from Julian day within the
current year. However, this default would not be appropriate for large
files and when multiple conversions are done within the same day. In
those situations, the user must provide the starting sequence number
which guarantees the trace number to be unique. </li>
</ul>
<p>These various parameters will be written to user preferences at the
end of the current user session, allowing them to be easily restored and
reused in your next session. </p>
<p>Generators</p>
<p>Convert/Generate is an integrated process where the generator is
accessible during the conversion process. Convert allows a generator to
be loaded, modified, saved, and ultimately used to create the output
file. This process is extremely integrated. Generator definitions are in
a common format that is shared with Make. </p>
<p>The “generate” tab defines all of the file level parameters that are
available. These parameters represent a generate configuration that can
be saved to xml and then repetitively used in the future. This reuse
allows you to ensure that the created files are always generated using
the same parameters and thus provide the same results. </p>
<p>Running Convert</p>
<p>Use the “convert” button to initiate the file conversion process.
Convert will launch a new validation process for the converted file,
which remains in memory after the conversion process has been run. You
must save the results to an external file when you have reviewed results
and determined that the output is beneficial based on your requirements.
</p>
<p>Standard Entry Classes</p>
<p>The ACH file format has certain standard entry classes which
represent a paper check item, and those formats are especially
appropriate for these actions. These are ARC, BOC, POP, RCK, and TRX.
Additionally, we support CCD and PPD since they are common layouts;
these may be used for data exchange within an organization, but should
not be used to route the resulting transactions on an external basis.
The supported standard entry classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARC, which represents an eligible check received via the U.S. mail
or at a drop box location, which was presented for the payment of goods
or services. The source document (the check) is used to identify the
Receiver’s routing number, account number, check serial number, and
dollar amount for the transaction. </li>
<li>BOC, which represents an eligible check received at the point of
purchase or manned bill payment location for the in person purchase of
goods or services. The source document (the check) is used to identify
the Receiver’s routing number, account number, check serial number, and
dollar amount for the transaction. </li>
<li>POP, which represents a payment for the in person purchase of goods
or services by Receivers. These debit entries are initiated by the
Originator based on a written authorization between the Originator and
Receiver and notice provided by the Originator at the point of purchase
or manned bill payment location. The source document, which is voided by
the merchant and returned to the Receiver at the point of purchase, is
used to collect the Receiver’s routing number, account number, and check
serial number that will be used to generate the debit entry to the
Receiver’s account. This type of entry may only be used for
non-recurring, in-person (at the point-of-purchase) entries for which
there is no standing authorization with the merchant for the origination
of ACH entries to the Receiver’s account.</li>
<li>RCK, which represents a debit initiated by an Originator pursuant to
an oral authorization obtained over the telephone to effect a transfer
of funds from a Consumer Account of the Receiver. This entry may only be
used when there is no standing authorization for the origination of ACH
entries to the Receiver’s account. A TEL entry would instead be used
when there is an Existing Relationship between the Originator and the
Receiver, or, when there is not an Existing Relationship between the
Originator and the Receiver, when the Receiver initiates the telephone
call.</li>
<li>TRC, which represents truncated checks being safe kept by the keeper
bank (Originator) as defined by a check truncation program. This entry
has one transaction per truncated check. The TRX format (which is not
currently supported by this conversion process) allows financial
institutions to use a single transaction entry to carry information from
multiple checks, where each check is identified within addenda records
attached to the item. </li>
<li>CCD, which represents funds are transferred between unrelated
corporate entities, or transmitted as intra-company cash concentration
and disbursement transactions. This entry class can be used for
standalone funds transfer, or it can support a limited amount of payment
related data with the funds transfer. The CCD class is not appropriate
for these items, but is included to facilitate data conversions for
files processed within a given single environment. </li>
<li>PPD, which Direct Deposit or Pre-authorized Bill Payment. Direct
deposit is a credit application that transfers funds into a consumer’s
account at the Receiving Depository Financial Institution. The funds
being deposited can represent a variety of products, such as payroll,
interest, pension, dividends, etc. Pre-authorized payment is a debit
application. Companies with billing operations may participate in the
ACH through the electronic transfer (direct debit) of bill payment
entries. Through standing authorizations, the consumer grants the
company authority to initiate periodic charges to his account as bills
become due. This concept has met with appreciable success in situations
where the recurring bills are regular and do not vary in amount
insurance premiums, mortgage payments, and installment loan payments
being the most prominent examples. Standing authorizations have also
been successful for bills where the amount does vary, such as utility
payments. The PPD class is not appropriate for these items, but is
included to facilitate data conversions for files processed within a
given single environment. </li>
</ul>
