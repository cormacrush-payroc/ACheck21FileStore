<p>Print Images is available with our X9Validator and X9Assist products
and includes facilities to print check images in various page layouts
which can be either system or user defined. A common use is to format
and then print item images to a MICR printer in a three images per page
layout. However, you can define and then print more complex scenarios of
up to twelve checks per page in a user defined grid format. Print Images
allows you to define and control the actual coordinates of printed
images on the physical page, which can be either letter or legal and
then either portrait or landscape. </p>
<p>Print Images requires that you first select the specific images to be
printed:</p>
<ul>
<li>All all images that exist in this x9 file;</li>
<li>Items defined within a filter which is created using tools such as
find or search</li>
<li>The current item displayed within the browser tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Print Images then requires that you select an image print format from
a drop down box which is populated with system defined format. Each
format defines how many images will be printed per page and the spacing
the images within each page. Several print formats are configured and
included on a standard basis with X9Assist. You can also use the Print
Images dialog to create and save your own print formats for subsequent
future use. This is an important function since it gives you fully
control your image print layouts. </p>
<p>Print formats define the attributes and page coordinates of your
check images when they are transferred to the printed page. The print
format contains various attributes that are used during the printing
process (paper size, orientation, title, margins, and most importantly
the actual x/y coordinates where checks will formatted and printed. </p>
<p>You can create new print formats by displaying an existing format,
making changes to it, and then saving it under an alternate name. Print
formats are stored in folder / Documents / x9_assist / xml/ printFormats
/. </p>
<p>Predefined Print Formats</p>
<p>The following print formats are included in our distribution. These
can be used as the basis to create new formats subject to your
requirements. The base formats are as follows:</p>

<p>Print Functions </p>
<p>Once you have selected your items and print format, you can then
initiate one of several available actions: </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Print</strong></em>: open a print dialog and initiate
printing to a selected printer. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Zip</strong></em>: write the formatted image pages to a
user selected zip file.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>V</strong><strong>iew</strong></em>: launch an external
viewer of the formatted image pages. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Preview</strong></em>: take a quick look at the
formatted pages that are formatted for print. </li>
</ul>
<p>View</p>
<p>View provides an interface to the system installed PDF or XPS printer
and viewer. This is a two step process where the image pages are written
to an intermediate file and then an external viewer is launched. In a
Windows environment, the Microsoft Print to PDF write will be used to
create an output file which will be launched in the default viewer on
this system. This facility provides better viewing than our preview
facility, but does take longer given the extra time that will be needed
to create the intermediate file. The functionality is excellent once the
viewer is launched. </p>
<p>Preview</p>
<p>Preview allows you to take a quick look at the generated print pages.
The next and previous buttons can be used to browse through the output.
The page number box can be used to jump to specific pages. The zoom
slider can be used to increase and decrease the zoom level of the
current image, along with the reset button which moves back to a
standard zoom setting. </p>
<p>MICR Line Redraw </p>
<p>Print Images includes enhanced functionality to redraw MICR lines
(within each image) from the associated x9 item data (for example, the
type 25 and 31 record types). This function should always be used for
IRD print. It may also be applicable to items that are created by our
Make/Generate functions, where the image MICR lines are known to match
the individual x9 data records. MICR line redraw can be selected only
when printing full scale images (when printed output has a single image
column). </p>
<p>The purpose of MICR line redraw is to optimize the quality of the
MICR lines when test documents are being printed for image enabled
capture environments (Branch Capture, ATM Capture, Image Lockbox
Capture, Remote Deposit Capture, etc). In those situations, it is
critical that the MICR line be printed at the highest possible DPI
supported by your printer, and not the 200 or 240 DPI that is present in
an attached image per x9 image exchange standards. To meet this quality
requirement, Print Images has the ability to directly redraw MICR lines
from the x9 data. When doing so, the MICR line data from your images
will not be used. This redraw function allows all MICR lines to be drawn
at the current printer resolution (not from the image DPI) which can
dramatically increase the quality of the scan line. </p>
<p>This functionality is appropriate only when performing IRD Print
functions or when the printed images were created by the X9Assist Make
or Generate functions. </p>
<p>MICR Line Redraw Usage Exceptions </p>
<p>There are certain conditions when MICR line redraw very explicitly
cannot be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of MICR line redraw is to improve the pixel quality of
the E13B characters within the MICR line and to thus improve the MICR
and OCR readability of those characters, with the intent to reduce digit
misreads. There is no reason to use this functionality if the paper
documents you are printing will not be subsequently recaptured.</li>
<li>You can only use MICR line redraw when you are 100% certain that the
x9 data matches the image data. This is typically NEVER TRUE for typical
x937 files, since although the image data is typically very close to the
x9 data, it is normally not an exact match. Hence this MICR line redraw
does not apply to typical x937 files and should never be used in those
situations. It can be used for files created by our Make/Generate
functions, since that is a much more controlled environment where the x9
data and the image data should match.</li>
<li>You similarly cannot use MICR line redraw when you are providing
your own MICR lines into Make, which is typically done for negative use
case testing of specific MICR line data content. In that situation, the
x9 data will not match your MICR line data, hence the redraw function is
not applicable. </li>
</ul>
<p>MICR Routing Redraw in xxxx-xxxx Format </p>
<p>The option to redraw MICR routings in xxxx-xxxx format (from eight
character routings) would normally always be enabled when MICR line
redraw is active. This function will redraw a routing of “12345678” as
“1234-5678”, essentially inserting the dash that was removed during
capture. </p>
<p>Some background may help here. This situation applies specifically to
US routings, which would typically consist of nine digits which include
a suffixed check digit and would never include an embedded dash.
However, prior to the implementation of the MICR routing check digit,
these numbers were instead formatted as “xxxx-xxxx” with an embedded
dash, thus making up the same nine character string that exists today.
Although most US routings now utilize the newer nine digit format, there
are various situations where the older 4x4 format is used. This
certainly includes old paper where customer accounts have not been
updated to the nine digit format that includes the check digit. </p>
<p>The x937 file specification has the routing divided into two separate
fields, which are the eight character routing followed by the check
digit. When the routing was actually in 4x4 format (with the dash and
without the check digit), then the x9 data is populated with the dash
removed. In that situation, the eight character routing is present and
the check digit is a blank to indicate that it was not present. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that these older routing numbers represent a
special condition for MICR line redraw, since the x9 data does not
actually contain the embedded dash. This option thus allows the dash to
be reinserted into the MICR routing when it was removed during capture
and is not present in the x9 data per the x937 specifications. </p>
<p>Printer Resolution</p>
<p>Print Image will automatically assign an appropriate DPI that is
optimized based on the work being performed. Specifically, Print Image
will enable 1200 DPI when printing items that are printed as MICR or
IRD, to be subsequently scanned. subsequently processed electronically.
The following print formats should be used: </p>
<p>Subject to the capabilities of your specific printer, all output is
typically printed at 600 DPI. However, this should be increased to 1200
DPI when printing IRDs or items that were created by our Make function.
This higher DPI setting is needed to minimize the potential for digit
misreads of these printed documents. In these situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Redraw MICR from x9 data” box should always be checked which
will use the MICR line data from the appropriate record types (25, 31,
61, 62, etc) to reformat an improved E13B scan line. </li>
<li>The “1200 DPI print is enabled as needed” box should also be
checked, which will enable 1200 DPI printing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Printer Drivers</p>
<p>In order to utilize our higher DPI print capabilities, it is
important that you use a printer with an associated print driver that
supports 1200 DPI printing. As an example, using an HP MICR Printer with
the generic HP printer driver may well result in a configuration that
does not support 1200 DPI printing. Although the printer is 1200 DPI
capable, it may be that the printer driver is not. </p>
<p>If you use a printer driver that only supports 600 DPI, then the
resulting check images will not be drawn at their expected size. This
problem is a result of attempting to print at 1200 DPI with scaling that
is ultimately not recognized by the printer. There are two ways to
resolve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a short term basis, make sure you do not check the “Enable 1200
DPI” box, which will ensure that printing is at 600 DPI. Although this
will resolve the problem, it is not optimal, since printed images will
not be at the highest quality possible. This could possibly result in a
higher digit misreads during subsequent scanning. However, note that it
is commonplace for images to be printed at 600 DPI, so this should not
create scanning issues. </li>
<li>On a longer term basis, we recommend that you consider installation
of a 1200 capable printer driver when you have a 1200 DPI printer. You
can either use a specific driver provided by your printer manufacturer,
or possibly use a generic driver (such as PCL or Postscript) that will
work with your specific printer. You should review the technical
documentation that from your printer vendor to determine your best
options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional important information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hewlett Packard “HP Universal Print PCL6” driver does not
support 1200 DPI. Although this driver works well in a general office
environment, it does not provide the higher resolution that is needed
for MICR printing. </li>
<li>The Richo “PCL6 Driver for Universal Print” driver includes support
for 1200 DPI.</li>
<li>The Xerox “Global Print Driver PCL6” driver includes support for
1200 DPI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Print Formats</p>
<p>Image pages can be defined and saved for future reuse using various
options and capabilities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify which images should be inserted for each item (front or
front/back) </li>
<li>Specify if you want descriptive captions printed below each item
image </li>
<li>Select collated print format</li>
<li>Select two sided print format </li>
<li>Load a predefined format (these are saved in the
/x9_assist/xml/printFormats folder) </li>
<li>Format in either a one column or two column grid </li>
<li>Format with up to six checks vertically </li>
<li>Define your image layout based on the number of rows and
columns</li>
<li>Select paper size (letter or legal) and orientation (portrait or
landscape) </li>
<li>Position the title, date/time, and page number based on your
template </li>
<li>Modify the title for each print request </li>
<li>Save new or modified layouts to the /x9_assist / xml / printFormats
folder so you can easily use them in future print sessions</li>
</ol>
<p>Collating</p>
<p>You can optionally collate your images when they are printed. This is
done to simplify the process of hand sorting the items after they are
cut and printed. If you select collation, the image print sequence is
modified so that you can cut the items by row and then easily restack
them. This option will eliminate the more difficult process of handing
sorting the items after they are printed. </p>
<p>Two Sided Printing</p>
<p>Checks can be optionally formatted for two sided printing. This
option is typically not needed, since printers also support this
functionality and will rearrange printed pages as needed based on their
specific requirements. Our two side page sorting is provided only has a
secondary function when absolutely needed. When two sided print is
active, front images will be printed on odd pages and back images will
be printed on even pages. The purpose of this page rearrangement is to
allow checks to be printed and trimmed such that their front and back
images are on the same piece of physical paper. </p>
<p>Cover Pages</p>
<p>Optional cover pages can be included in the printed output. These
will be leading pages that include basic attributes of the input file
(file name, folder name, file size, number of records, etc), along with
key fields from the file header and trailer records. There will be one
or more cover pages printed. The number of output pages is largely
dependent on the number of batches that are included within the file.
</p>
<p><strong>Item Descriptors</strong> </p>
<p>Optional item descriptors can be included in the printed output. A
descriptor box is formatted and inserted for each item, which includes
information about the item itself (from the item record) and then from
the attached addenda records. When item descriptors are enabled, other
options such as two sided printing, collated, and image boxes should be
turned off. </p>
<p>Creating Custom Formats</p>
<p>If you are creating a custom print format, you should follow these
general steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your paper size and orientation </li>
<li>Use auto-layout to define the row / column configuration for the
check images</li>
<li>Indicate if you want front images only, or if you want to include
back side images</li>
<li>If needed, then modify your border sizes based on the PDF template
</li>
<li>Specify the location for your title, date/time, and page number
</li>
<li>Finally, adjust the locations of your check images based on your
layout requirements </li>
</ul>
<p>Image Size</p>
<p>Print Images will attempt to maintain the exact image size of your
selected checks. Image size can be preserved based on the combination of
image size, paper size, and orientation. For example, typical retail
checks can be printed three per page using letter (8.5 x 11) with
portrait orientation. Print Images will progressively reduce the
resulting image size based on the parameters that you have selected.
</p>
<p>Printing to a PDF</p>
<p>You can optionally print to an output PDF (and not to an actual
printer) by installing one of many PDF virtual printer products that are
available. One such example is “Microsoft Print to PDF” which has been a
Windows component since Windows XP; there are others. These PDF printers
act as a logical printer and will intercept your generated image stream
as your output is generated. By using such a tool, you can easily write
your print stream to a PDF file. You can then take the PDF file into
other applications and tools of your choice. </p>
