<p>The Item Viewer is launched from the DashBoard using either the tool
bar or the menu bar and provides access to several panels and tools that
can be leveraged for the current item. The purpose of the Item Viewer to
to use the entire panel to provide information regarding the current
item. For x9 files, a large scale image can be displayed which provides
image details that otherwise may not be readily visible from the smaller
images that are displayed within the DashBoard.</p>
<p>The Item Viewer allows the current item to be displayed in one of
several modes which are selected from the action line at the bottom of
the panel. The available modes are:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Viewer Panel</strong></p>
<p>The Viewer panel is a consolidated panel which contains detailed
information for the current item, which includes the field number, field
name, field value, and an icon which represents any errors which were
identified during validation</p>
<p><strong>Field Values with Leading/Trailing Blanks </strong></p>
<p>The value column is formatted to provide insight into how and where
blanks are present within the data value. Leading and trailing blanks
are displayed as a shaded gray area to make their presence and
visibility more apparent. This formatting does not impact embedded
blanks, but only the leading and/or trailing blanks that may appear as
part of field justification. </p>
<p><strong>Browsing Functions</strong></p>
<p>The Item Viewer includes previous and next functions which allow you
to easily walk through the items that are located within the current
file, using the entire viewing space of your screen size, thus
maximizing the data you can see and scroll through. When paging forward
or backward, the Item Viewer will continue to show items until the very
last item within the current file is displayed. This browsing process
may automatically move forward to the next bundle or cash letter based
on the current file structure. The Item Viewer will return to the
DashBoard when there are no more items to be displayed within the
current file. </p>
<p>Modif<strong>ying Images </strong></p>
<p>When users are licensed for modify, the Item Viewer has tools which
allow the front and/or back images for the current item to be modified.
This is accomplished using various icon-based tools that are available
on the toolbar, followed by a replace function. Our UI has implemented
image modification here, since this allows you to actually see the image
as changes are made. For example, possible steps to modify an image
might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharpen the image.</li>
<li>Deskew the image for better horizontal alignment. </li>
<li>Repair the image to rescale (if needed) and recreate tiff tags.</li>
<li>Replace the image, which attaches the modified image to the current
item.</li>
<li>Closely review results.</li>
<li>Save the modified file to an alternate file name.</li>
<li>Use X9Assist-Compare to compare the original file to the modified
file. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the replace function is used to attach a modified image to the
current item, it can be subsequently reverted from the modification log.
</p>
<p>Item Viewer Tools</p>
<p>The following x9.37 tools are available within the Item Viewer:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Export</td>
<td>For x9 files, individual images can be exported to externally stored
image files. These images can be written in TIFF format, but can also be
written in other standard industry image formats such as PNG, JPG, GIF,
etc. When images are exported in TIFF format, the exported TIFF file
will contain the <em><strong>exact</strong></em> TIFF image data that
exists on the x9 file (the same segments, TIFF tags, etc). </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Copy</td>
<td>For x9 files, individual images can be copied to the clipboard. This
is a very convenient way to move images from X9Assist to other desktop
applications. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Strip</td>
<td>For x9 files, appends a MICR strip using the actual item data from
the current item record. The data will be extracted from the current
item record which may for example be a 25, 31, 61, or 62. This function
is very useful when you want to visually compare the image against the
data that exists within the file itself. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>OCR</td>
<td>For x9 files, appends a MICR strip using data from an OCR Read,
which is based on the X9Ware E13B-OCR product. The MICR data is
extracted from the actual front side TIFF image. This function is very
useful when you want to visually compare the image against our OCR reat
results. The ? Button can subsequently be used to gain more insight into
our E13B recognition process. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>MICR Gauge</td>
<td>For x9 files, displays a MICR gauge as an overlay against front side
images. This tool allows you to easily confirm that a MICR line has been
properly positioned within the clear band area (the bottom 5/8 inches of
the image). </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Density</td>
<td>For x9 files, displays the pixel density for the current image,
which is either the “top” image (when both images are being displayed)
or the current when in zoom ode. This tool can be used even when IQA is
not enabled and provides insight into the too light or too dark
attributes for any given image within an x9 file. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Sharpen</td>
<td>For x9 files, applies our sharpening tool to the current image and
thus attempt to remove background noise. Depending on the condition of
the image, the sharpened image may improve your image visibility and
otherwise bring data into focus which is otherwise not readily viewable.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Blur</td>
<td>For x9 files, applies our standard blurring tool to the current
image to simulate scanner issues. If our standard blur does not meet
your needs, we have included steps (documented below) to export an image
so you can apply blurring using an external image tool such as GIMP.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Deskew Left</td>
<td>Slightly rotates the image left to attempt to remove possible
capture skew. The undo button can be used if the results are not
acceptable. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Deskew Right</td>
<td>Slightly rotates the image right to attempt to remove possible
capture skew. The undo button can be used if the results are not
acceptable. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Flip</td>
<td>Changes the image orientation by 180% (horizontal flip). </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Exchange </td>
<td>Exchanges the front and back images for this item. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Repair</td>
<td>Attempts to repair the image using our TIFF repair capabilities.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Undo</td>
<td>Undo recent changes that have been done within this item viewer.
Undo cannot reverse changes after a replace has been done; that can only
be done through the modification log. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Next</td>
<td>The next item will be displayed within the current file. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Previous</td>
<td>The previous item will be displayed within the current file. </td>
</tr>

<p>X9 Image Replacement</p>
<p>Image changes are logged in the same manner as field level
modifications. Image changes can similarly be viewed using the
modification log and can be reverted in the same manner.</p>
<p>Images can be replaced using one of the following standard
facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current viewer image: </strong>the current viewer image will
be used to construct the replacement image. This image may have been
modified using one or more tools such as sharpen, deskew, or repair.
</li>
<li><strong>Load external image</strong>: a replacement image is loaded
from an external image file. If the replacement image is in TIFF format,
then the byte array for that image will be inserted into the type 52
record exactly as it appears in the external image file; no image
manipulations will be performed. If the image is in another supported
format (PNG, JPG, GIF, or BMP) then it will be converted to a standard
TIFF image that is compliant with the x9.100-181 exchange standard. This
includes conversion to black/white as needed. You retain the most
control over your replacement image when it is provided in TIFF format,
hence it is our recommendation to do that whenever possible. </li>
<li><strong>Missing</strong>: the standard missing image document will
be used to replace the current image (which might be either a front side
image or a back side image). The missing image document is a standard
document that can be customized to contain specific data per your site
requirements. There are separate missing-front and missing-back images
that can be defined as needed. </li>
<li><strong>Both as missing</strong>: the standard missing image
documents will be used to replace bot the front side and back side
images for the current item. This is typically done when the wrong item
image is associated with the current x9 item. </li>
<li><strong>Zero length image</strong>: field 52.18 will be set to zero
which implies that no image is present within the type 52 record.
However, the type 52 record is retained within the item group. </li>
</ul>
<p>Blurring an Image</p>
<p>It is occasional desirable to blur an existing image, as a negative
use case for image processing. Creating blurred images is a complex
process for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image manipulations needed to blur an image are in themselves
complicated.</li>
<li>There are various blurring techniques that can be applied which will
result in different results. These various tools need to be tried
through a trial-and-error process, to achieve the best output subject to
your requirements. </li>
<li>Various parts of an image can be blurred. You may want to blur parts
of the MICR line, the CAR/LAR fields, other image fields, or the entire
image to emulate a bad camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>The toolbar includes our standard blur which can be applied to an
image. However, if our standard blur does not meet your needs, you can
use this alternative sequence of tasks to utilize an external tool (like
GIMP) to manipulate the image. GIMP not only has various blurring tools,
but also allows the blurring to be applied selectively to the image,
with do-undo support as you work on the image. You do not need to use
GIMP, you can use another tool of your choice. </p>
<p>The sequence of steps to accomplish image blurring (or other image
manipulations) is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the item that you would like to manipulate. </li>
<li>Double click the front thumbnail image, which will put you into the
item viewer.</li>
<li>Using the buttons at the bottom, you can export this one image out
to a file name of your choice.</li>
<li>Now use another image tool to blur this image. My tool of choice
would be GIMP. Once you’ve finished, export this image as a PNG.</li>
<li>Go back to X9Assist, open up the file, and go back to this
item.</li>
<li>Turn on modify using the upper right hand corner check box that’s on
the dashboard.</li>
<li>Now modify the type 52 front image record.</li>
<li>Inside the modify record panel, you will see field 52.19 at the
bottom. Click modify to modify this image. </li>
<li>Use the button options to indicate you would like to replace the
image from an external image.</li>
<li>Go into the file system, and select the image that you have blurred
and saved.</li>
<li>The selected image will now replace the original image, and you will
see it in the item viewer.</li>
<li>Finally, you can say this X9.37 file and you will have the image
exactly as it has been modified and within this file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have the modified file that contains a blurred image,
you can either send it for image processing, to a downstream
application, or print if that would be preferred.</p>
<p>Hex Viewer</p>
<p>The Hex Viewer allows individual records to be viewed in hexadecimal
format, as they appear on the input file. This viewer provides several
important capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is logically parsed into individual records based on actual
data length</li>
<li>The four byte record length prefixes are shown when they exist
within the file (when they exist as the physical length of each logical
record)</li>
<li>For x9 files, the tiff image data from the type 52 image view data
records is included </li>
<li><p>Each data record includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record number</li>
<li>Record length</li>
<li>File offset</li>
<li>Hexadecimal data (in either the Ebcdic or Ascii character set)</li>
<li>Translated character data </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Structurally Flawed Files</p>
<p>An important feature of the Hex Viewer is that it is automatically
invoked when a structurally flawed file is opened. The purpose of this
interface is to provide as much information as possible when flawed
files are opened. </p>
<p>These are always difficult situations and can easily turn into
complex discussions. Most x9 tools provide little to no information on
flawed files. However, X9Assist is designed to intercept these parsing
errors and give you as much insight (as possible) as to where the error
exists.</p>
<p>When a structurally flawed file is open, X9Assist will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a pop-up message with information on where the problem was
encountered.</li>
<li>Will then position you within the Hex Viewer at the point of the
parsing failure. </li>
</ul>
<p>The pop-up message contains the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li>The number of records parsed up to the break point</li>
<li>The percentage of overall data that was successfully parsed </li>
</ul>
