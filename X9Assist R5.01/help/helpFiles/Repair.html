<p>Repair can be utilized to apply automated repair actions against the
currently loaded file. Repair is designed to operate as a series of
actions which can be applied to record types and their associated
fields. You can select both the actions and the record types (as well as
the individual fields) that are eligible for a repair operation. Repair
actions have been purposely designed around situations where errors can
be automatically addressed without negatively impacting the original
intent of the file as created by the originator. </p>
<p>Repair is especially suited to correcting trailer records where the
data is known to be correct but the totals in the trailer records are
determined to be incorrect. In these scenarios, the trailer contents can
be recomputed from the available data. </p>
<p>Repair is similarly well suited for “brute force” corrective actions
such as correcting data alignment within fields, correcting truncation
indicators, or blanking out user or reserved data fields when that is
required. </p>
<p>Repair includes the ability to correct images. There are two
available options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace errant images with missing image documents: Error images
will be replaced with your defined “missing image” document. Note that
this document can be customized as part of your product installation.
</li>
<li>Redraw errant images using the image data: Error images will be
redrawn using the image data that is present, which will generate new
tiff tags that meet required industry standards. If image inspection
determines that an image is not usable, then it will instead replace
that image with a “missing image” document. </li>
</ul>
<p>Selective Record Type and Field Repair</p>
<p>Repair allows the scope of the repair actions to be limited to
specific record types and/or fields. This is a powerful process since
this allows the user to target all actions to a limited number of fields
which will be targeted by the repair process.</p>
<p>Modify Integration</p>
<p>Repair is fully integrated with the Modify process. All field level
changes that are created by Repair will create modification log entries.
When Repair ends, you can view all of the field level changes that have
been applied to your file by launching Modify and reviewing the log.
This provides several advantages. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can both review and launch to any record that was modified by
Repair. </li>
<li>You can individually revert any change that has been applied by
Repair.</li>
<li>Finally, the modification log is available to your via Export or can
be automatically created and written to a folder by Save.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repair Results</p>
<p>On completion, Repair will provide a summary of the corrective
actions that have been taken against the currently loaded file. This
summary will include the total number of records that were repaired and
then a list of repair actions by record type. </p>
<p>If record types are repaired that you have determined that you want
excluded, you can revise your repair criteria and run the repair action
again. To do that, you will need to reload the original file and start
anew. </p>
<p>Repair will then launch a new validation process for the repaired
file, which will provide an updated status on the errors that exist
after the automated repairs were applied. </p>
<p>The repaired file remains in memory after the repair has been run.
You must save the results to an external file if you determine that the
results are beneficial. </p>
<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>We are interested in your suggestions regarding possible new repair
actions that can be added to our automated repair process. Ideal repair
actions must be generic in nature (applicable to all files) and must be
associated with corrective actions that will result in the creation of a
repaired file that meet industry standards and are acceptable to a large
number of financial institutions. </p>
