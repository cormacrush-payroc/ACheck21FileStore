<p>Compare is used to compare record and image data across two x9 files,
subject to possible field exclusions. The currently loaded file is
compared against a secondary file which is user selected. This is an
excellent regression testing tool since it confirms that a modified file
is logically equal to an original file, which could be the current file
before modifications or a previously verified file which contains
expected results. </p>
<p>Compare requires that the items within the file be structured in the
same logical order to allow the matching process to remain aligned
within the two files. Positioning is internally maintained by record
type and then additionally on item amount and item sequence number.
There are no other assumptions or requirements for the matching process.
Any missing or inserted items will be reported and optionally listed.
</p>
<p>The compare process reports on field level difference by field name
when there are individual records that are aligned by the matching
process. This makes it easier to identify the actual differences between
two records that have been matched. The compare process also reports on
records determined to be inserted on one side or the other of the
matching process. These records are present on file one but are not
present on file two. </p>
<p>Reviewing Differences</p>
<p>The compare process is invoked as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the 'select' button to select the secondary file to be used for
the compare. Once a file is selected, it will be located and summary
information will be provided which helps you determine if you want to
continue with the compare. </li>
<li>After statistics are confirmed, then use the 'compare' button to
initiate the actual file compare process. Differences will be displayed
as identified. The progress bar will be updated as the compare
continues. A text file will be written to the TEMP folder and can be
used (as needed) when you require a log of the identified differences.
</li>
<li>Once the compare has been completed, the “differences' button can be
used to obtain a summary of all fields across all record types which
were determined to be different. </li>
<li>The “launch' button can be used to invoke a more detailed file
comparison (at the record level) when a compare tool is available for
your environment. This process can be very informative since it provides
a better visual comparison of the differences between the two files.
This comparison includes image lengths but not the actual image data.
The compare tool itself is pluggable and can be modified based on your
specific requirements. </li>
<li>Use the 'reset' button to reset and allow the currently loaded file
to be compared to another secondary file. </li>
</ul>
<p>Excluding Fields</p>
<p>The default is to compare all fields within all record types. There
are times when that is not appropriate. For example, you may have
modified an application that creates files and you know that as a result
of that change you are expecting a certain field to have different
contents. In this situation, it is very helpful to explicitly exclude
that one field from the comparison so you can then easily determine that
all other fields within the file are equal as expected. This exclusion
is accomplished by using the selection panel on the right. One or more
fields can be excluded from the compare process. You should indicate the
fields to be excluded before you select the secondary file to be
compared. </p>
<p>Implementing an External Compare Tool</p>
<p>The file compare process can be further enhanced by adding an
external compare tool. This compare can then be launched after the file
compare has been completed and allows you to do further analysis of any
differences which may exist. This is an optional process to add value to
your environment. This is a text-to-text comparison of two text files
which are created during the compare process. Launch of the external
compare tool allows you to visually explore the differences between the
two files that have been compared. This is possible due to the powerful
string matching capabilities of the text compare tools that are
available in the industry today. </p>
<p>X9Assist is not hard-wired to a specific external comparison tool.
You can implement the preferred external comparison tool of your choice
through the “comparex9.bat” batch script. This single batch script is
used to both identify and launch the comparison tool. This batch script
allows the compare tool to be generic and external to our comparison
process.</p>
<p>Our distribution by default supports the following external compare
tools:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>WinMerge: a freeware Windows alternative. </li>
<li>Meld: a freeware alternative which is available for Windows and
Linux. </li>
<li>UltraCompare: a powerful file edit / compare tool and an industry
leader which is installed by many organizations on a world wide basis.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Batch file “comparex9.bat” is located in the program launch folder. A
parameter of “-isDefined” is initially invoked to determine if the
compare tool exists. This pre-launch must return an exit code of 10 when
the compare tool exists. The compare is then launched using this same
batch file, using two parameters which represent the two files to be
compared. The comparex9.bat file can be modified to invoke the preferred
tool for your environment. </p>
<p>WinMerge Usage </p>
<p>The following options should be set to maximize your usage. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>View from the menu bar</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Enable line differences</li>
<li>Enable line numbers</li>
<li>Enable margins</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Options (wrench) from the tool bar </p>
<ol type="a">
<li>General – enable compare white space</li>
<li>General – enable ignore case </li>
<li>Editor – enable view line differences at character level </li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Meld Usage </p>
<p>The “up arrow” and “down arrow” on the tool bar can be used to skip
to each identified difference within the compare.</p>
<p>UltraCompare Usage </p>
<p>The “up arrow” and “down arrow” on the tool bar can be used to skip
to each identified difference within the compare.</p>
