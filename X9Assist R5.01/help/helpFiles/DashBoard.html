<p>The Dashboard contains high level information regarding the currently
loaded file that has been parsed and validated. It serves as the summary
panel for all information that has been collected and allows you to
easily launch various system functions. </p>
<p>The Menu Bar is available at the very top of the panel and is used to
launch application functions. Each entry within the menu has a drop down
that is activated on a single click. Most functions have an assigned
keyboard speed that can alternatively be used for initiation. </p>
<p>The Tool Bar (which contains icons) is available immediately below
the Menu Bar and can similarly be used to launch application functions.
The Tool Bar can be easier to use than the Menu Bar for commonly used
tools. </p>
<p>The Dashboard contains tabs on both the top and right sides:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs with their title in <strong>black</strong> contain information
at the file level. These tabs are presented in right side tabs within
the Dashboard. For example, the “Records” tab contains summary
information about the various record types that exist within the current
file. </li>
<li>Tabs with their title in <strong>blue</strong> contain detailed
information which will be updated as your positioning within the file
changes. For example, the tab for the “Field Viewer” has field level
information for the current record group that is selected within the
browser tree. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Dashboard top side tabs are as follows: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Dashboard</td>
<td>A summary of information associated with the file that is currently
loaded. This includes bulletins (messages) and a summary of all
identified errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Field Viewer</td>
<td>A window shows the current record or record group, on a logical
record by record and field by field basis. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Images</td>
<td>A panel that allows selection of either the front side or back side
image (x9 files only). </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Dashboard right side tabs are as follows: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Tab</td>
<td>Applies to X9?</td>
<td>Applies to ACH?</td>
<td>Description </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Summary</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>A summary of information associated with the file that was
processed. This includes file attributes and the record types that are
present on the file. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Info</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>A list of the file level bulletins that were created when the file
was loaded and validated. </td>

<tr class="even">

<td>Yes</td>
<td>A summary of all record types that exist within the file. </td>

<tr class="even">

<td>A list of the cash letters that exist within the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bundles</td>
<td>Yes</td>

<td>A list of x9 bundles that exist within the file. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<p>The feedback panel is displayed at the lower portion of the
Dashboard. It contains Record Data, Errors, and the Images panel. It is
located at the bottom of the Dashboard and presents additional
information for the current record or record group that is selected
within the viewer.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Record Data</td>
<td>Shows the complete record data exactly as it was received. This can
be very helpful when there are questions about the positioning of fields
within the record or how fields are justified or padded. All errors are
listed after each individual record. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Thumbnail Images (x9 files only) </td>
<td>The front and back image thumbnails are shown in the lower right
corner of the Dashboard. This is helpful to allow you to quickly see
both the front and back images for each check. The Item Viewer is
launched when either thumbnail is clicked, providing a larger image
view. Once the Item Viewer is displayed, you can then click either the
front side or back side image for an even larger view of these images.
The size of the thumbnails can be changed using sliders that are
available on both the left and top of this image area. These sizes are
recorded in user preferences and will be used for each user session.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The ICL Viewer tree is on the left side of the panel and can be used
to view the structure of the overall file and to launch the display of
any given record. The tree includes a tab which contains navigational
information which describes how the tree is used and speed keys that can
be used for simplified access. </p>
<p>The Status Bar is displayed at the bottom of the Dashboard and shows
attributes of the current file. This includes the file name, file type
(x9 or ach), rules configuration that was used for validation, record
count, file size, character set encoding, and finally the number of
errors that were identified during validation (errors, warnings, infos).
</p>
<p>The Progress Bar shows the percentage of work that has been completed
for a given task. The Progress Bar will go to 100% and will then
disappear when a task has been completed. </p>
