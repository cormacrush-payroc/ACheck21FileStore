<p>New files can be opened in one of several manners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the open button on the tool bar;</li>
<li>Using the open recent button on the tool bar; </li>
<li>Selecting FILE and then OPEN from the menu bar. </li>
</ul>
<p>Files are automatically identified (x9, ach, cpa005, etc) based on
their file name and contents based on the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>File extension matching is applied first, where Program Options
contains a list of the file extensions for each of these categories.
This assignment (using the file extension) takes precedence over
subsequent methods. </li>
<li>Data inspection is applied second, where record content and data
lengths are used to explicitly identify x9 versus ach data files. This
logic leverages optional binary record lengths and then specifically
inspects for valid record types subject to format. </li>
<li>Invalid files (those that fail all inspection techniques) are
assumed to be in the x9 format and will ultimately be displayed as
structurally flawed. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Program Options to simplify the process of opening new
files:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The default input file folder location. </li>
<li>Wildcard strings which are used to explicitly identify the format of
user file names. These wildcard strings can be as simple as simple as
*.x9 or *.ach, and thus identify files based on file name extensions, or
can be more complex using file name patterns and the wildcard characters
* and ?. Within the wildcard patten strings, the special character (?)
Is used to represent a single wildcard character while (*) is used to
represent one or more characters. For example, a more complex wildcard
string might be *icl*.x9 which would accept file names with the string
“icl” embedded within their name and with a specific file extension.
</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, the list of files is restricted to those files that have
file names that match the wildcard strings which are assigned in program
options. </p>
<p><strong>Please remember that a list of file extensions (or more
complex wildcard strings) are defined in program options and can be
customized to simplify your file selection process. </strong>You can
review and update this list of file extensions by invoking the options
maintenance facility. These file extensions are maintained on the
primary “x9” tab. </p>
<p>The “<strong>Look in</strong>” box at the top of the file open dialog
can be used to easily move to any folder location that you need across
the entire file system. Using this box, you can navigate to the drive
and folder that you want to select from You can then select and open the
image cash letter you would like to open.</p>
<p>If you need to open a file with some other extension, you can use the
“<strong>Files of Type</strong>” drop down at the bottom of the panel to
change to All Files. This will display all files in the current folder
regardless of extension, which will allow you to select any file with
any extension. You can also use “<strong>Files of Type</strong>” to
individually select your custom wildcard selection strings. </p>
<p>As a reminder, HELP is provided on the right side of the file open
panel. This help information serves as a reminder of how to use the file
chooser panel. You can HIDE this information once you are familiar with
the process. </p>
<p>Panel Dimensions</p>
<p>The file chooser panel can be resized (both horizontially and
vertically) to increase the number of files that can be viewed based on
your monitor size. If you resize this panel, your new dimensions will be
saved in preferences and applied to future sessions.</p>
<p>List versus Details Mode</p>
<p>You can use the View Menu drop down box in the upper right hand
corner to select either list or details mode. Details mode provides
access to both file dates and file sizes which can be very helpful when
searching and selecting files. File chooser columns can be dynamically
sorted on these columns. View mode can be defined in program options and
your most recent setting will be saved in preferences and applied to
future sessions. </p>
<p>Supported x9 File Formats</p>
<p>X9Assist supports all file formats that are currently exchanged
between financial institutions, and will automatically detect the
attributes of the file being opened. Once these attributes are
determined, they will then be checked against your rules to determine if
attributes (as present) are valid or should be considered as an error.
These file attributes are as follows: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Character set</td>
<td>The character set can be Ebcdic or Ascii. This is determined by
inspecting the first record on the file (which will be the file header)
and assessing the character set based on the how the record type is
encoded within that record. The UCD standard is Ebcdic character set
encoding.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Field Zero </td>
<td>The term “Field Zero” is often used to describe the four byte record
lengths that may exist as a prefix to each x9 record. X9Assist can run
either with or without these record lengths. If the field zero lengths
are present, X9Assist can process then in either big endian or little
endian byte order. The UCD standard is for field zero to be present and
as big endian.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Tiff Images</td>
<td>Tiff images include an Image File Directory (IFD) which can be
defined in either big endian (Motorola) or little endian (Intel) byte
order. The UCD standard is for Tiff images to be in little endian byte
order. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p><span id="anchor-3"></span><span id="anchor-4"></span>File Chooser
Dialogs</p>
<p>File dialog boxes are used through the application to open and save
files. This functionality is used extensively within X9Assist so it is
important to leverage the capabilities that are available to you.</p>
<p>X9Assist will always suggest the initial folder that is used by a
file dialog box to select a file. This will be helpful in some
situations, depending on the location of the last file that you opened
and what you intend to do next. This functions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last input path is remembered and used as the starting folder
for open input requests.</li>
<li>The last output path is remembered and used as the starting folder
for open output requests.</li>
<li>There is an override in program options that indicates open output
operations should be alternatively routed to the last input path. By
default, this option is enabled, which allows you to easily save output
files in the same folder where they were opened from. </li>
</ul>
<p>Program Options allows you to select one of two file dialog
interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Java based file chooser, which is unique to Java and is
independent of the current operating system. This is the default
option.</li>
<li>A native OS file dialog, which uses standard operating system
facilities in support of file selection interactions. For example, in a
Windows environment this will be the standard Windows file dialog that
is typically used by most applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are pros and cons associated with both of these file dialog
interfaces. We support both since one or the other may be more desirable
depending on your usage and your specific environment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive testing has shown that the native OS file dialog tends to
be more robust and performs well when your directories contain a very
large number of files. However, with the introduction of Java SE7, the
Java file chooser is performing better, so this appears to be less of an
issue. The Java file chooser had performance issues when folders
contained large ZIP files, but that issue was also resolved with SE7.
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the native OS file dialog does not support file
filtering and does not provide any easy mechanism to filter based on
file extension. We have an implementation for that, but is less than
desirable. The Java file chooser does a much better job in this area.
</li>
<li>The native OS file dialog includes some additional file functions
that are not available with the Java file chooser. These options are
available by right clicking on the file name within the dialog box. For
example, you can easily rename a file within the dialog. </li>
<li>Our implementations allow you to resize either dialog box and we
will persist those custom dimensions in the preferences file. The
resized dialog box will be used in future sessions. </li>
</ul>
