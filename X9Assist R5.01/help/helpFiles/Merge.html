<p>Merge allows the content of one or more additional user selected
files to be appended to the end of the currently loaded file. Merge is a
convenient way to combine multiple files into a single (larger) file.
This is helpful in several different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you want to combine various files with different test cases
into a single file that can be used for ongoing testing. </li>
<li>When you want to combine multiple files to create a single larger
file, possibly to be used for stress testing purposes. </li>
<li>When you purposefully want to create invalid data conditions by
combining data of unlike transaction types within the same logical file.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Merge can be run repetitively to include more and more data into a
single file. This is helpful when you are pulling in files from multiple
input folders. When doing multiple merges, you must save the results
each time to an external file before proceeding to the next merge step.
</p>
<p>Merge will automatically renumber the bundles (batches) as needed to
ensure that their individual identifiers are unique. </p>
<p>For x9 merge, you have the option to either merge as bundles or merge
as cash letter(s). When you merge as bundles, the bundles from the
selected x9 file will be appended to the last cash letter that exists
within the currently loaded x9 file. </p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>When you merge as cash letters, the cash letter(s) from the selected
x9 file will be appended to the end of the currently loaded x9 file.
</li>
<li>When merging as bundles, you have the additional option to copy the
origination / destination RT from the cash letter header record to the
merged bundles. This is a validation requirement per UCD rules. This
option will only be applied when merging bundles is selected. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which merge process is selected, you have a common
option to assign new item sequence numbers to all output items. When
this option is selected, new sequence numbers are assigned to both the
current and the inserted (merged) items. Selecting this option will
ensure that your new x9 file does not have duplicate item sequence
numbers. </p>
<p>Selecting Files</p>
<p>You can select multiple files as input to a single merge operation.
This is done in a standard way based on your OS platform. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can select multiple files by holding down the CTRL key as you
select individual files.</li>
<li>You can select a range of files by selecting the first file within
the range and then holding down both the CTRL and SHIFT keys as you
select the last file. </li>
<li>You can select all files within a folder by using the CTRL A key
combination. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your selected files will be displayed in the “Selected Files” panel
on the right.</p>
<p>Identifying the Output File</p>
<p>Merge by default will write to an intermediate file which is located
in the temp folder. This default action is appropriate since it is
important that you closely review the created output file before you
save it to your target file. However, in some situations, it can be
beneficial to bypass the writing of the intermediate file and instead
write the merged output directly to you target output file. Doing so
saves a step which can potentially take a measurable amount of time, and
especially when results are being written to a networked drive. </p>
<p>In support of this optimization, Merge allows you to optionally
choose your target file (before the merge process is initiated) thus
eliminating creation of the intermediate file. When doing so, the target
file will still be reread and validated on completion. You should
closely review the created file and ensure it is correct based on your
requirements and before it is used for any subsequent purpose.</p>
<p>Initiating the Merge</p>
<p>Once you have selected files, press the Merge button to initiate the
merge process.</p>
<p>Merge will launch a newly created file validation process for the
resulting merged file. It is very important to review the validation
results to ensure that the created file does not have any unexpected
errors. The merged file remains in memory after the merge process has
been run. If the output was written to the intermediate file, then you
must save these results to an external file once you have determined
that the results are corrected and beneficial per your requirements.
