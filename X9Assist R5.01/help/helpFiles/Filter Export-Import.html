<p>Filters represent a subset of items within the currently loaded file.
Any individual item can be only occur once within a filter, but can
exist in separately defined filters at the same time. The items within a
filter are arranged in a sequential order (relative to how they appear
within the current file) regardless of the order that they may have been
added. </p>
<p>Please read the “Filter” topic for more information regarding filters
and their capabilities.</p>
<p>Filter export-import share a common CSV format, which means that an
exported filter can be subsequently used by the filter import tool. A
filter can be created using our various functionality (find,
search/replace, individual item selection, etc) and then exported to an
external CSV file. In more advanced situations, filters can also be
created using other external tools to address user specific needs. The
filter identifies individual items. It can then be subsequently imported
from the exported filter content. An exported filter contains the
following five (5) fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item sequence number</li>
<li>Amount</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Account number</li>
<li>Check number</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, filters are used through several consecutive steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, build a filter using a tool such as find. This allows you to
enter item selection criteria which is then matched against the
currently loaded data file. The result will be a filter tab that
contains the matching items.</li>
<li>Second, use the filter-export tool to export the item selection
criteria to a CSV file. Export always writes the output CSV file in a
standard five column format (ittem sequence number, amount, routing,
account number, and check number).</li>
<li>Finally, at some future time, some other file can be loaded and the
exported CSV criteria file can then be imported and matched against the
current data file. This allows the already entered criteria to be
applied again, to some other file. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, CSV filters can be used for more expansive purposes other
than just our standard tools. For example, you might have an external
process that creates an account number list filter, containing just two
columns (routing and account number). This could be considered to be
general purpose pick-list that could be applied frequently to files, as
needed. This filter could be maintained using a text editor, but could
also be a dynamic list that is created by an application program. Once
this list is constructed, it can be imported and then applied to any
file that is loaded.</p>
<p>In this situation, you need to describe columns that are associated
with your CSV criteria file. Our standard is to have five attribute
columns, but you can have less or more than that depending on your
specific requirements. Just as importantly, the columns do not have to
be consecutive, which means that you might have a CSV file from some
other purpose that can be imported an applied. In these situations, just
remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load/Save is used to define the filter configuration, which defines
the columns that are to be used for matching. Many users will not need
this, since they are using our standard five column attributes
definition. However, if this is not the case, then you can configure and
save your own column definitions. This information is stored as an XML
file in folder / xml / filter.</li>
<li>Import is then used to load the CSV datea file, which is mapped
based on the current filter configuration. </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that filters can be used for a variety of purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create File can be used to create a new file that contains only
those items that exist within a selected filter (this uses the filter
list for inclusion). </li>
<li>Create File can be used to create a new file that does not contain
those items that exist within a selected filter (this uses the filter
list for exclusion). </li>
<li>Delete items from the currently loaded file. </li>
<li>Image Print the selected items. </li>
</ul>
