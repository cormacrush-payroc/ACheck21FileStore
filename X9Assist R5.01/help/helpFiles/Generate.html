<p>Generate is a powerful data generation tool that allows you to create
files from scratch to meet your specific testing requirements. File
creation is typically a two step process, which consists of Make
followed by Generate. Although these are often discussed as separate
functions and topics, they are integrated into our Make function
allowing them to be viewed and run as a single tool. </p>
<p>Make and Generate provide very different functions: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make</strong> is used to create items. </li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong> is used to wrap those items with the
header and trailer records that are needed to build a valid file. For
x9, this also consists of optionally drawing images that match the item
level data, allowing CAR/LAR to be be run against the constructed file.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the input to Generate should be viewed as individual
items which can be either debits or credits. Generate has a large number
of parameters which allow you to tailor the data generation process to
your specific requirements. We would like to hear from you about how
this function can be improved. Your suggestions are welcome. </p>
<p>Generate Configurations</p>
<p>Over a period of time and as part of your testing processes, you will
most certainly use Generate to manufacture different test data for
varying purposes. Each of these may require different parameters to
allow you to assign the appropriate data for the file header records,
cash letter header records, and so forth. </p>
<p>Generate simplifies this process by allowing you to define and then
save a Generate configuration. You can then restore and reuse this
configuration in the future. This eliminates the need to repetitively
enter information and also eliminates the potential for errors and
omissions. </p>
<p>Input to Generate</p>
<p>Although Generate is design to work in combination with Make, it can
also function independently. You can run Generate directly from the
toolbar. When you do so, you will receive a prompt screen where you will
identify the input file that should be used by Generate. This must be an
Excel file (XLS or CSV) that contains the logical representation of your
data records. </p>
<p>Generate will accept file (x9 and ach) and cash letter header (x9)
records when they are present on the input CSV file. If you provide
these record types, they will be used exactly as presented for file
generation. If these record types are not present on the CSV input file,
Generate instead creates these control records from the configuration
parameters. </p>
<p>There are three types of inputs that can be processed by
Generate:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Generate</td>
<td>Applies to X9 ?</td>
<td>Applies to ACH ?</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Output from Make. </td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Items from Make flow into Generate. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Output creation by your own internally developed applications. </td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>You can develop processes which create this same file format and
then feed that input directly into Generate. This scenario is used when
you want to build your own item based data generation system, and you
want to leverage the Generate capabilities as part of your process.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CSV files which are essentially in export format, structured as
records and fields. </td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>CSV files that are specifically contain type 25 records (checks). If
you are creating a deposit, then this file can also contain one or more
type 61 credit reconciliation records. If type 61 records are present,
they must precede their respective checks. The amounts on the type 61
credit reconciliation records can be specified as zero, allowing
X9Assist to automatically calculate the credit amounts from the debits
that follow. If you specify the credit amount on your type 61 record (it
is not zero), then your amount will be used. You can have more than one
type 61 record on your Excel file. When type 61 records are present,
there must be at least one check that follows each credit. This check
file can also optionally include a file header (type 01), cash letter
header(s) (type 10), and the various check addendum records; when
present, these user supplied record types will be used by Generate
instead of being artificially created. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>New Batches / Bundles</p>
<p>Items will begin in a new bundle in one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The item count per bundle is exceeded (as defined in your
generator).</li>
<li>The item is a credit, and your generator indicates that credits
should begin in a new bundle.</li>
<li>You populate values in Bundle Cycle Number, Bundle User Field, or
both of these columns. A new bundle is started automatically when these
columns are populated and the value changes. </li>
<li>You forcibly indicate that an item should begin in a new bundle. You
can do this using the debit/credit indicator column, where you instead
insert the keyword “Bundle” on a row by itself (since this row is a
separator and will not contain an actual item). Doing so will force the
subsequent item to begin in a new bundle. </li>
<li>You insert a “Y” in the new bundle column as identified by your
reformatter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Dates</p>
<p>Generate utilizes various different dates when creating output x9
files. Default values are assigned to each of these dates, and you can
also modify these assignments based on your requirements. The dates
assignments are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>File create date/time (default value is assigned as current
date/time). </li>
<li>Business date (default value is assigned as a Mon-Fri that is one
day before the current date). </li>
<li>Secondary endorsement date (default value is assigned as a Mon-Fri
that is one day before the business date). </li>
<li>BOFD endorsement date (default value is assigned as a Mon-Fri that
is one day before the secondary endorsement date). </li>
<li>Beginning and ending dates for created check images. Dates are
assigned sequentially (within your provided range) as virtual check
images are created. </li>
</ul>
<p>These above four dates are all currently exposed and modifiable
through the Generate user interface, on the dates tab. For example, the
type 50 record is generated with the BOFD endorsement date, and the type
52 is also generated with the BOFD endorsement date.  </p>
<p>Generate – X9</p>
<p>Generate has a standard set of columns that is utilized by Make and
can also be constructed by client specific applications. Be advised that
this list of fields may change from release to release, so if you create
an application that uses this interface, you should design it in such a
manner that it can be updated in the future should changes be needed.
Please reference the notes panel that is provided by Generate (from the
tool bar) for a complete list of these fields. </p>
<p>Generate looks at the incoming Excel file and determines which of
these three file types it is being presented with. This is determined
based on the record types that are on the file and the number of fields
(columns) that are actually present in the data. You do not need to tell
Generate what type of file you have. But you do need to ensure that it
follows the rules associated with these three file requirements. </p>
<p>Generate will create all of the items (checks) that are routed to it
for processing. Your decision as to how many checks to generate must be
made by the tool that you are using to create your input to Generate.
For example, within Make, you can specify how many items that you want
created which will control the number of checks that will ultimately be
on the x9 file from Generate. </p>
<p>Obviously you can use other tools to create your Generate input file.
The Generate input can come from the X9Assist Export function, but can
also come from your tools that manufacture your own test cases or use
Export output to build consolidated files that represent your specific
testing requirements. </p>
<p>When Generate first starts, it will read the input file and extract
the check information that is present. It will also assign default
values to any data that is missing. For example, it must do this if you
are providing an ICL extract since there will be several ICLR based
fields that are not present in your input. </p>
<p>Generate will inform you of the number of checks it has found on the
input file and the total dollar amount. You can double check this
against your expectations before you actually generate your x9 file.
</p>
<p>Optional CSV Record Types<strong> – X9</strong></p>
<p>Generate allows you to provide certain record types on your incoming
CSV file and can then optionally use these record types when the new
file is constructed. </p>
<ul>
<li>File and cash letter headers</li>
<li>Check addendum records</li>
<li>Return addendum records </li>
</ul>
<p>Use of this facility can allow you to utilize Generate for more
complex situations and not  have to revert to writing an application
that feeds import. For example, if you need to use specific file and
cash letter header records in your output file, you can cut and paste
these records into your CSV file and then have Generate use those
records. You can similarly do this with the check and return addendum
records.</p>
<p>Use of these record types makes it possible to take Export output and
then use that to easily create new files. You can export an existing
file, remove various records from that file, and then have Generate use
the resulting file with your defined Generate configuration. </p>
<p>Sample CSV Input File <strong> – X9</strong></p>
<p>This is a sample CSV input file to generate that will create a
deposit using a type 61 credit reconciliation format. The credit format
(Metavante or DSTU) must be selected via the Generate parameters. Note
that the credit amount is zero so it will be automatically calculated by
X9Assist based on the credits that follow. </p>

<p>Generation Parameters<strong> – X9</strong></p>
<p>Generate parameters allow the creation of both x9 and ach files.
These parameters control the batching of items and the values that are
populated in file headers and trailers. Generate related parameters are
provided on the “right” side tabs of the Make panel. </p>
<p>Generate parameters include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All file header field values can be assigned </li>
<li>Credits can be automatically inserted to offset debits </li>
<li>Addenda can be created</li>
<li>Bundle size can be controlled </li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Images<strong> – X9</strong></p>
<p>Generate will dynamically create images from one of several available
options:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Create missing image documents </td>
<td><p>Images will be created from your defined “missing image”
document. Note that this document can be customized as part of your
X9Assist installation. </p>
<p>Creating missing image documents is the fastest image generation
option. This is because individual images do not need to be drawn and
then converted into TIFF format (which is the most time consuming part
of the image generation process). If you are doing repetitive x9 file
creation as part of a testing process, you can consider initially
inserting missing images until the x9 file is being created per your
requirements. Once the x9 file is correct, you can then do the more time
consuming process of generating individual images. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Create missing image documents that include MICR lines </td>
<td>Images will be created from your defined “missing image” document.
Note that the missing image document can be customized as part of your
X9Assist installation. The created missing image documents will include
a MICR line that is drawn from the x9 data. </td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Draw images using the generated MICR and amount information for the
check </td>
<td>Images will be drawn using the generated information that is being
assigned to the type 25 check detail record. X9Assist will ensure that
the image meets tiff standards. You can customize information regarding
the drawn image on the “draft check” tab within program options. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Image Templates<strong> – X9</strong></p>
<p>The Image Templates tab is used to select the check artwork that will
be used for image generation. </p>
<p>There are various categories that are used to store templates for
image generation:</p>
<ul>
<li>business</li>
<li>credits</li>
<li>rcc</li>
<li>retail</li>
</ul>
<p>If a check has an Aux OnUs field, then Generate will attempt to use a
template from the business category. If no templates have been selected
from the business category, then Generate will fall back and utilize a
retail template. </p>
<p>Addition points for consideration: </p>
<ul>
<li>Available formats are defined in folder / x9_assist / xml /
templates /. This folder contains file “templates.xml” which is an index
of all available formats by category. </li>
<li>You can add formats to templates.xml to define your own check
formats. These definitions include the fonts and point sizes that are
used to dynamically draw check images. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transformations – ACH</strong></p>
<p>Addenda transformations allow existing items files to be into
automatically converted into more complex returns and notification of
change files. This functionality will create new addendas based on your
provided parameters. Using the transformation drop down, you can create
files for returns, notifications of change, dishonored returns,
contested dishonored returns, and refused notifications of change. </p>
<p>These transformations are purposefully designed to be as simple to
use as possible. Via the transformation panel, you can provide a list of
values in a CSV format, separated by commas) which will be applied to
the generated addenda. These values are used on a circular (round-robin)
basis, allowing specific data to be assigned within the created
addendas. However, if you omit the transformation data, then generate
will instead create the addendas using a variety of randomly assigned
reason codes, change, codes, and information strings. This random
assignment allows you to create a complex file in seconds. </p>
<p>When you first begin using the transformation function, you should
omit the transformation data and allow generate to automatically
construct the addenda records. This core functionality may be all that
you need. For more advanced requirements, you can optionally assign the
transformation data to be used, which will be saved with your generator
for future reuse. The most basic value to be assigned is the return or
change reason code(return reason, change reason, dishonored reason,
contested reason, or refused change reason). This is a three character
value ("Rxx" or "Cxx") and applies to all transformations. This can be
entered as a single value (eg, R01) or a list of values (R01,R02,R03).
There are optionally more complex data formats, which are defined as
follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>NOC data is formatted as "changeCode|changeData".</li>
<li>Dishonored returns data is formatted as
"dishoneredReason|returnReason|addendaInformation".</li>
<li>Contested returns data is formatted as
"contestedReason|dishoneredReason|returnReason".</li>
<li>Refused notification of change data is formatted as
"refusedCode|changeData". </li>
</ul>
<p>These expanded data formats are optional and allow you to further
tailor the constucted data to your specific requirements. </p>
<p>Although these system generated transformations are quick and easy,
they are also a bit brute force in nature and do not always provide the
granularity needed to satisfy more complex use case requirements. In
those situations, you should instead consider using our Make function,
where spreadsheet input can be provided on an item by item basis. Using
Make is a much more detailed approach, where you fully define all
contents, and hence allows you to take complete control over the entire
data assignment process for each addenda record. </p>
<p>Generation</p>
<p>Use the “Generate” button to initiate file generation. This can be a
lengthy process if you are drawing a large number of x9 images. Once the
output file is created, you will be placed in the viewer so you can
browse results. You can also save the generated file for external use,
allowing you to send files to your capture and downstream applications.
