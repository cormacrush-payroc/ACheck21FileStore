<p>The binding process is designed to allow incoming files to be
validated per specific user requirements, where rules are appropriately
applied based on the type of file that has been received. The design
goal is to attempt to do all of this on an automated basis based on
header record inspection. X9Assist refers to this processing as
<em><strong>binding</strong></em>, with the attempt to automatically the
correct rules to specific file content. </p>
<p>The x9 standard level within the file control header identifies the
x9 specification that was used to encode that specific x9 document.
Unfortunately, due to a goal to maximize file compatibility across the
various x9 specifications, the x9 standard level is field can be
insufficient in many situations to fully and accurately identify the x9
standard to be applied to a given x9 file. Binding and mapping provides
automation to supplement this decision process. </p>
<p>Across many financial institutions, the combination of Origination
and Destination Routing can be used to fully define the validation rules
that are to be applied to the file. X9Assist allows this definition to
be by Routing, but also allows the definition to be done on a generic
basis for Origination Routing, Destination Routing, or both. </p>
<p>For example, you can define the configuration to be applied to a
specific Destination Routing regardless of origination. Or you can
define the configuration to be applied to a specific Origination Routing
regardless of destination. In many environments, the configuration can
be assigned from the file header Standard Level and UCD Indicator, with
no need to drill down to the Origination and Destination Routing
levels.</p>
<p>Through use of the Mapping Editor, you can provide automated
instructions to the binding process which allow you to define overrides
(exceptions) that are based upon the Origination and Destination Routing
from the x9 file header. This allows you to ensure that X9Assist will
automatically use the correct configuration file based on your specific
requirements. </p>
<p>System Entries versus User Entries</p>
<p>A system entry is one which is created internally and added to this
table. The content of system entries may change from release to release.
The editor will allow user entries to be modified or deleted, while
system entries are not allowed to be changed. </p>
<p>Use of the Mapping Editor </p>
<p>The Mapping Editor defines the rules which are used by the Binder to
automatically assign incoming x9 files to system defined configurations.
This automated bind process is largely accomplished based on the
contents of the type 01 file control header. </p>
<p>The following file control header fields are used to drive the
automated bind process and can be specified using the Mapping
Editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Origination Routing </li>
<li>Destination Routing </li>
<li>Standard Level</li>
<li>UCD Indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>Each entry within the mapping table is defined as either a system
entry or a user entry:</p>
<ul>
<li>System entries are automatically added (internally) by
X9Assist.</li>
<li>User entries can be added and maintained by the user. These
definitions can either supplement or overrides to the system entries
that are internally created. </li>
</ul>
<p>By first establishing configurations and then defining your mapping
to those configurations, you can provide information to X9Assist to
automatically use the appropriate x9 and tiff rules when applying
validations to an x9 file. For example, if you have a specific and
consistent destination RT that is used for image exchange files, you can
easily direct X9Assist to automatically apply the correct edits to those
files. </p>
<p>These fields are concatenated and used to construct a logical key
which must be unique for each entry added to the Mapping Editor.</p>
<p>The status column provides an indication if the defined configuration
has been located and that all rules associated with the configuration
exist. </p>
<p>Entries can be deleted by selecting them (via their check box) and
then selecting delete. </p>
<p>This table must be saved for your changes to be effective. The reset
button can be used to restore to your last save point. Results will be
saved to xml/map.xml.</p>
<p>Mapping Entry Load Sequence </p>
<p>The mapping file is loaded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process begins with an empty table. </li>
<li>User entries are first loaded to the table from the “map.xml” file.
All user entries from this file are sequentially loaded to the table
(note that system entries on “map.xml” are ignored since they will
instead be reconstructed and added at load time. The key for each user
entry (origination routing, destination routing, standard level, and UCD
indicator) must not exist within an existing table entry for the new
entry to be loaded. </li>
<li>Standard system entries are then dynamically created and internally
added to the mapping table. Each system entry is loaded only when it's
mapping key (origination routing, destination routing, standard level,
and UCD indicator) does not already exist within the table. This means
that a system entry will not overlay and will thus never replace a user
defined mapping entry. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hierarchical Search</p>
<p>The search process against the mapping file is one using specific
values followed by a generic value of “all”. For example, the search is
done using the origination routing, and if an entry is not found using
that specific value, then it is substituted with a value “all” and the
search is repeated. This hierarchical search is performed until a
matching mapping key is identified. In a worse case scenario, a key of
“all/all/all/all” will used until on a default basis to identify the
configuration to be used for x9 bind. This means that an
“all/all/all/all” entry must always be present. </p>
<p>X9 System Configuration as defined in Program Options</p>
<p>You can define the configuration that will
<em><strong>always</strong></em> be used in program options. This is
done from the “X9” tab using the “X9 System Configuration” setting. </p>
<p>The default is for this to be <em><strong>system
assigned</strong></em>, which means that the configuration will be
determined from the contents of the x9 file header. X9Assist will then
use either X9.37 or X9.100-187 + UCD rules to apply validations based on
the contents of the file header.</p>
<p>Through use of program options, you can override this process to
always use a specific configuration file. For example, if your standard
is to always use the newer X9.100-187 + UCD validation rules, then you
can define this in your program options. In this way, binding is no
longer dynamic based on the contents of the file header, but instead
will always be done using your specified configuration. </p>
<p>Endpoint Validation</p>
<p>X9Assist has the ability to validate the Origination and Destination
routing numbers that are present in the file header. Use of this feature
is optional, which means that you can allow all such routing numbers to
be received and accepted. You can also decide to validate the
Origination Routing, the Destination Routing, or both of these fields.
</p>
<p>This validation includes the ability to define an endpoint with start
and end dates which define when x9 files will be accepted. Depending on
your application environment, it may be possible to extract and even
synchronize the endpoint table from your electronic cash letter system
and make that available to X9Assist in support of this validation
process. </p>
