<p>X9Assist is designed to apply all applicable validations to the
incoming x9 and ach files. Each record field can have one or more
assigned validations, all of which must be satisfied for the field to be
considered to be valid. The field viewer shows the validation rules
which are being applied to each field which is helpful to gain insight
when running the same file against alternative rule sets.</p>
<p>X9Assist is supplied with an extensive list of configurations which
implement the validation rules for each of the commonly used standards.
These validations are implemented through system supplied XML
configuration files. It is possible to extend the standard edits that
are packaged and distributed, but also please be aware that this is an
advanced topic which requires a thorough understanding of the standards
themselves. It is recommended that any user modifications be stored in
separate configurations so they do not overlay the standard rule
definitions. As part of Extended Support, X9Ware will provide consulting
services to help with any such customization efforts. </p>
<p>There are various field level edits that are defined within the
validation standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field presence can be either mandatory or conditional. The standards
state that a mandatory with a defined values list must contain one of
those values to be considered as valid. Validation of conditional fields
is more complex, which the term conditional means that the content of
one field may be conditional on the content of other records and fields
within the currently loaded file. Generally, conditional fields are
essentially optional where their content can be blank, which means that
a conditional field with a defined values list can normally be blank and
still considered to be valid. However, this validation is dependent on
the specific conditional field and the rules surrounding that
conditional presence. The standard developers are a bit vague in these
areas, with the presence of many fields identified as based on “clearing
arrangements” which indicates that the rules are agreed upon by the
originator and receiver. </li>
<li>Fields can be defined with a data format attribute. For example a
numeric field can only contain the characters zero through nine, which a
numeric blank field can contain the values zero through nine as well as
trailing blanks. </li>
<li>Fields can be assigned a data alignment attribute, which indicates
if padding blanks (when present) must be on the left or right. For
example a numeric blank field is justified left which dictates that any
padding blanks must be on the right. </li>
<li>Fields can have a defined values list, which provides a specific
list of allowable values for the fields. A field can also have multiple
value lists, where its allowable content varies based on the value of
other fields that exist within the file. </li>
</ul>
<p>Rule Definitions</p>
<p>File validation is driven by xml documents which define record types,
fields, field attributes, and the edits that are applied to each field.
These definitions are located in the following folders: </p>
<ul>
<li>/rules/messages/: contains a list of error messages and the severity
assigned to each. Although most installations will have a single
messages file, it is possible to implement to vary the messages (with
their severities) based on the file standard. </li>
<li>/rules/tables/: contains a series tables with a list of values by
table name. Table validations are applied by the
&lt;edit&gt;table/tablename&lt;/edit&gt; rule. Tables are useful when
the same list of values are applied to numerous fields and there is a
desire to only define those allowable values in a single location.
Tables are also useful when the list of valid values is extremely
lengthy and thus not a good candidate for direct value checking. </li>
<li>/rules/tests/: contains a series of test sets which are designed as
test-pass-fail rules. Test set validations are applied by the
&lt;edit&gt;/test/testSetName&lt;/edit&gt; rule. Each test set consists
of a series of tests which are applied sequentially to validate a field
value. Each test results in true or false. A test set is considered to
be passed when the first successful test is encountered. If all tests
are false, then the field value has been determined to be unacceptable
and failed. Each test test assigns its own unique error message to
describe the failure, along with an optional severity level. Refer to
the SDK User Guide for more detailed information regarding the test set
rules facility. </li>
<li>/rules/tiffrules/: contains a series of tiff validation rules which
define the allowed attributes of the tiff images that are embedded
within the file. The tiff rules contain parameters to allow the values
of individual tiff tags to be validated, and also indicate which tiff
tags are mandatory and must be present within the tiff images. The tiff
rules can be used to dictate the image format of the primary binary
(bi-level) images that are attached to each item, as well as optional
secondary images which can be gray scale and thus contain a different
set of attributes and tiff tag requirements. Refer to the SDK User Guide
for more detailed information regarding the TIFF validation rules.</li>
<li>/rules/x9rules/: contains a series of validation rules which define
the allowed content of files. The rules represent the core of our
validation engine and drive the validation of each file. These rules
indicate which record types may be present within the file, the fields
that make up each record definition, and the validations that are
applied to each field. Refer to the SDK User Guide for more detailed
information regarding the validation rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validation Rules</p>
<p>The rules engine implements the following proprietary design
principles: </p>
<ul>
<li>A validation set can be either a basis document or an extension
document. </li>
<li>A basis document defines a core specification. </li>
<li>An extension document defines a new specification that is built upon
a defined base. When defining an extension, only the differences
(against the base document) need to be defined and all else will be
automatically inherited. This approach substantially reduces ongoing
maintenance, since a change basis is automatically applied to any
defined extensions. It also allows you to quickly and easily understand
what is different in the extension specifications. </li>
<li>Each specification has a set of controls which define the high level
attributes associated with the rules. For example, the controls might
indicate if the allowable character set is EBCDIC, ASCII, or
EITHER.</li>
<li>A base document must contain a controls definition and need only
define those values that vary from the system defaults. </li>
<li>An extension document must contain a controls definition and need
only define those values that vary from the base document. </li>
<li>Each specification is defined as consisting of a series of record
types. </li>
<li>Each record is defined as consisting of a series of fields. </li>
<li>Each field is defined with its specific attributes and validation
criteria. </li>
</ul>
<p>TIFF Rules</p>
<p>The TIFF rules engine similarly implements the following proprietary
design principles: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each TIFF specification has a set of TIFF controls which define the
high level attributes associated with the TIFF rules. For example, the
TIFF controls might indicate that duplicate tags are accepted or are not
accepted. </li>
<li>Each TIFF specification can have separate set of TIFF rules for
Black White versus Gray Scale images. </li>
<li>Each set of TIFF rules contains a list of TIFF edits that are
applied to tags when they are present within an image. </li>
<li>Each set of TIFF rules contains a list of TIFF tags that are
mandatory for each image. </li>
<li>The TIFF specification contains a list of descriptions of all
possible tags that can be present across all images within the x9 file.
</li>
</ul>

rules and how they can be extended to meet your specific requirements.
