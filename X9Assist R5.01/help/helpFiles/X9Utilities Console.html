<p>The X9Utilities Console is an interactive tool that is available
within both X9Utilities and X9Assist. The console is a powerful facility
that allows command line parameters to be entered, validated, and then
submitted for execution. It serves as a good demonstration of the
overall capabilities of X9Utilities, since it allows the command line to
be constructed visually, with validation of files and command line
switches as they are entered. The console allow X9Utilities to be run on
demand. It intercepts and displays the system log as x9utilities is
executing. It then displays the final exit status that is posted by the
x9uti.exe. </p>
<p>The console is an integral part of X9Utilities itself, and launched
using the “-console” switch on the command line. By using this approach,
it is not a separate program but instead embedded within the standard
x9utilities runtime. </p>
<p>The console allows allows a set of parameters can be save to xml as a
“run unit” that can be subsequently loaded an executed again. This is a
provided as a productivity tool, since it allows a given set of
parameters to be saved and executed again in the future, as needed. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned, X9Utilities is a command line tool. In your
production environment, it will be invoked on a batch (command line)
basis. This might be from a scheduled batch script, or more possibly
directly by an application program. The console can serve as a workbench
for your testing. It provides an illustration of x9utilities
capabilities and operation. </p>
<p>The console is made available as part of X9Assist since that product
is a desktop tool, is designed with a UI (User Interface) for human
interaction, and is our full-function desktop product. X9Assist
customers can use the console to actually run X9Utilities interactively
in their environment. An X9Utilities license must be purchased if you
subsequently decide that you would like to run the tool on batch basis.
</p>
<p>This documentation describes how to use the X9Utilities Console.
However, it does not provide detailed information on each of the
functions that are available via that batch (command line) utility.
Please reference the X9Utilities User Guide (which is available in its
entirety via help) for complete information regarding functions,
capabilities, and command line options. </p>
<p>X9Utilities Evaluations</p>
<p>The console can be used during X9Utilities evaluations, to both
simplify and expedite the review process. Product evaluations are
normally performed within a limited time frame and hence productivity
factors are important. The console helps greatly during this process,
since you can run any X9Utilites function from start to end within
minutes, without the need to develop a batch script. You can also repeat
the same test using a variety of input files, and can save the work unit
for further repeated testing at a later time. All of these capabilities
can add a lot of value during an evaluation of our X9Utilities product,
so it represents a great way to get started. Once you have determined
that your evaluation is favorable, X9Ware can then provide an evaluation
copy of X9Utilities, which will allow you to perform the same operations
on a command line basis. </p>
<p>X9Utilities Batch File (Windows) </p>
<p>The console can be invoked using a batch file. A sample of this is
included as part of the Windows installation, in folder: / samples /
console / .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@echo off</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>: Run the x9utilities using a start command, which allows it to run
separately and the consolse window itself to close. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cd "c:/Program Files/X9Ware LLC/X9Utilities R4.11"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>start "" x9util -console</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>: pause </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>exit /b</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Console Fields </p>
<p>The X9Utilities Console contains the following fields which allow you
to identify the function to be performed along with their associated
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Function” is a drop down box which allows the X9Utilities task to
be selected.</li>
<li>“Batch” is a check box that is used to indicate that batch
processing is activate. This is a more complex runtime mode, where a
command is executed against all of the files within a folder (instead of
against a single file). When using batch mode, the input file must be
defined as as wild-card string, where an asterisk is used for pattern
matching during the file selection process. Refer to the topic
“Batch/Script Operations” in the X9Utilities User Guide for more
information. </li>
<li>“Threads” applies only when running in batch mode, and identifies
the number of threads that will be used during work unit processing.
</li>
<li>“Wild Card Pattern” applies only when running in batch mode, and
defines the pattern that will be applied when selecting files within
folders. An example might be *.x9. </li>
<li>“Command Switches” is a list of switch values which are to be
applied to the selected task. The entered switches must begin with a
dash and must be valid for the selected function to be performed. Refer
to the X9Utilities User Guide for more information.</li>
<li>“Rules Specification” is used to select the x9.37 specification to
be associated with the selected task. For example, the specification is
critical for the “-write” since it identifies the x9 rules to be
utilized, which identifies key information such as fields and field
alignments.</li>
<li>“Command line as executed” is a display box which summarizes the
command line that will be executed for the selected task. The command
line will be updated interactively as changes are made to the above
fields (function, switches, rules, etc). </li>
</ul>
<p>Input and Output Files </p>
<p>The X9Utilities Console includes a facility which must be used to
define the input and output files that are processed. There are various
files that can be specified, with certain files required based on the
function being performed. These files are selected via a file chooser
and the fully qualified file name is then displayed in the text box
immediately to the right of each selection box. The chosen input and
output files will be passed to X9Utilities via the command line. It is
also informative to take a look at the command line box to see how input
and output files are provided to X9Utilties via the constructed command
line. </p>
<p>The following input and output files can be specified:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Translate</td>

<p>Work Units </p>
<p>A work unit is a combination of all entered fields which describe the
X9Utilities task to be performed. A work unit can be saved to xml and
then subsequently loaded at a future time, allowing the work unit to be
performed again. The load and save buttons on the right side panel are
used for this purpose. Work units are stored in folder / documents /
x9_assist / xml / x9utilities /. The ability to save and subsequently
reuse work units allows task to be performed repetitively as needed.
This might be used to perform a user periodic task and eliminates the
need to create a batch script for that same purpose. Work units can not
only be stored, but can also organized into subfolders within /
documents / x9_assist / xml / x9utilities /. </p>
<p>X9Utilities Console</p>
<p>The console is used to display system log information for each new
task that is executed. The console is initialized at the start of each
new task and will be updated with log snapshots as the task is run.
There are limits as to how much information can be shown within the log,
which requires some truncation when the logging becomes excessive. In
these situations, logging will be suspended. The console will still
contain the very last lines from the log, which is important since these
lines may contain output file names, totals, error messages, etc.
Console content can be scrolled (using the scroll bar on the right) and
can be copied to the clipboard (using CTRL A and then CTRL C). Once
copied to the clipboard, the text can be pasted into other external
applications as needed for specific purposes. </p>
<p>JDK Requirements</p>
<p>The console requires JDK 11 or higher for execution. </p>
<p>Function Execution</p>
<p>User input is edited interactively and errors and shown when
identified. Once a valid work unit has been entered, it can be
optionally saved and ultimately executed using the run button on the
action line. Many tasks will run very quickly. Depending on the function
performed, the number of files involved, and the relative size of those
files, the run may take an extended period of time. The console has
several indicators to inform you that a utility task is running:</p>
<ul>
<li>The background of the X9Utility console is changed from gray to cyan
while the task is in a running state, and will be changed back to gray
on completion.</li>
<li>Exit status on the action line will be changed to “running” while
the task is in a running state, and will be changed to the numeric exit
status on completion.</li>
<li>The status icon on the action line will be changed to a “runner”
image while the task is in a running state, and will be changed back to
a green/red icon on completion. </li>
</ul>
<p>A popup message will displayed on completion that provides the exit
status and the name/size of the output file. The elapsed time (in
seconds) will also be displayed on the action line. </p>
<p>Command Line as Executed</p>
<p>The console includes a display box which shows the command line as
executed. This is provided for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First is that it provides details on how the command line is
formulated and thus is very helpful for exposure into the technical
workings of the utility. You can compare the content of the formulated
command line against the X9Utilities User Guide to fully review the
command formats. </li>
<li>Second is that the command line can be used as the basis for
developing batch scripts. This would be done by fully testing the
function to be performed, and then by creating a batch script from the
command line. The new batch script may have certain parameters or file
names turned into symbolic parameters, increasing both flexibility and
usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrations</p>
<p>The following are examples of using the utilities console through a
series of sequential operations:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(1)</td>
<td>Export x9.37 data + images into fixed column CSV format.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(2)</td>
<td>Export x9.37 data + images into variable column CSV format.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(3)</td>
<td>Import x9.37 from an exported file, or a CSV of your creation. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(4)</td>
<td>Compare two x9.37 files. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>Reusing a Saved Work Unit </p>
<p>The console can be used to save a work unit to xml for subsequent
reuse. This work unit can be used to the batch version of X9Utilities to
rerun this command in a batch environment. This can be useful when a
function needs to be performed in a batch environment and can be
repeated exactly as originally performed via the console. In some
situations, this may eliminate the need to develop and test a batch
script to perform the same function. The work unit is provided to
X9Utilities using the <strong>-workUnit:“-fully qualified file
name”</strong> command line parameter. No other parameters or switches
are required. You can review the created xml file for more insight into
the work unit xml definition and embedded content. </p>
