<p>Reversals can be used to create a new reversals file using one or
items from the currently loaded file, typically from a list of filtered
items. Input to this process can be either a filter that contains the
specific items to be included in the new file, or alternatively the
entire content of the current file. Filters may be created using the
PickList, Find, Search, and Error Summary functions. </p>
<p>A common use of this tool is to respond to a file that has been
previously created in error. In these scenarios, an entire file will
have to be reversed. This reversal process must be used extremely
carefully, since you never want the reversal file to be flawed as well.
This means that you need to fully understand the reversal process, and
more importantly closely review the resulting output file that is
created. This review needs to be done by your operations and technical
teams (it needs multiple reviews and sign-offs). The review needs to
look at the transactions, transaction codes, addenda records, file
headers/trailers, and file totals. A careful review must always be
performed.</p>
<p>You can create the new file directly from the selected items or you
can instead route the items through the Generate function. If you create
the file on a direct basis, then the selected items will be written
exactly as they appear within the current file (including the attached
addenda and image records). Items will remain within their current file
and bundle structure. </p>
<p>As described above, ACH and CPA005 reversals can be either written
directly or processed through Generate. The primary reason to go through
Generate would be to further customize the output file (eg, change the
header/trailer records). X9 files must go through Generate, since those
items must have their images redrawn as debit-credit memos. In this
situation, our standard check templates can be used, or you can
alternatively design your own template based on your specific
requirements. </p>
<p>Reversals files have their debits flipped to credits and
alternatively credits flipped to debits. These transaction code
transformations vary a bit by dialect, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>X9 is the most complicated, and especially when credits are defined
as type 25 records with some type of transaction code and/or routing
number. A user defined configuration table can be constructed that
identifies the transaction code and/or routing number to be assigned to
POD credits. This swap table can have one or more entries, where the
first matching entry will be selected and applied. Reversals will be
always routed through Generate, which will be used to set further output
file attributes. This must include the credit record type and format,
and the image templates to be used to when creating the reversal
transactions. </li>
<li>ACH and CPA005 reversals are much more straight forward. Most
typically, an entire file will be reversed. A transaction code swap
table is provided for ACH, where the default should be appropriate based
on industry standards. A transaction swap table is not needed for
CPA005, since reversals are identified as a separate record type. </li>
</ul>
<p>Offset Balancing</p>
<p>Reversal files can consist of debits, credits, or both. In some
situations, the file may consist of debits offset by a single credit, or
credits offset by a single debit. In this case, the reversal process
recognizes that there is a single offset transaction and will ask if the
amount on that balancing item should be modified. When using a filter,
if the offsetting item is not included in the filter, then reversals
will ask if that item should be added. Note that our automated balancing
process requires at least two items offset by a single item. These items
can be be located in different batches. If the offset exists in a batch
by itself, then that batch structure will be retained even when a filter
is being used to identify the items to be reversed. </p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Reversals is a powerful tool that can be used to create new files
from specific items of your selection. Using the interface to Generate,
you can also customize the file header information and other parameters
associated with the newly created file. These parameters can be saved in
a generator that can be referenced and invoked in future user sessions.
