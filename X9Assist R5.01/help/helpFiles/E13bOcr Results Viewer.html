<p>The E13B OCR Results Viewer provides insight into the results of our
character recognition process, as applied to the current front-side
image within the Item Viewer. This includes the front image itself,
image as deskewed, the isolated MICR line, recognition results, and all
logging information that was generated by our recognizer. If recognition
for a specific image is inaccurate and if you believe that the results
should be improved upon, then we would very much like you to use the zip
process (below) to create documentation that you can provide to us,
which is the very detailed information that we will need to improve the
OCR recognition engine. We have implemented this exporting process since
it will provide just a single image to us for this analysis (we do not
need the entire file). We realize that this will one image will contain
PII (personally identifiable information), which you must take into
consideration. We will use the data only for analysis purposes. We will
then delete it and inform you when it has been removed from our system.
This feedback is what we need to provide continuous improvements to our
E13B recognition engine. </p>
<p>This OCR technology is proprietary to X9Ware LLC and based solely on
our development efforts. The implementation is 100% Java and represents
the only E13B OCR solution (that we are aware of) that runs within the
JVM. This character recognition is not dependent on JNI (Java Native
Interface) wrappers used to execute external machine dependent code
(most typically written in C or C++). </p>
<p>Our recognition engine analyzes the image through a series of steps
which include skew detection, re-orientation, noise removal, and
character matching. The recognition process uses advanced character
framing that attempts to match a character despite pixel noise that
might surround it, including handwriting that spills into the MICR line
area. The matching process is based on both character size and shape.
There are both primary and secondary matching algorithms, where the
secondary is applied as confirmation only when the primary method is not
highly confident. </p>
<p>Code line recognition accuracy approaches 99.8% accuracy when
presented with with good quality scanned images. Throughput has been
measured at 15 items per second when single threaded and over 50 items
per second when running on four concurrent threads (which is the
implementation used here within our Item Viewer). </p>
<p>Panel Content</p>
<p>The following images are included within this viewer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original – the original front-side image as routed into the
recognition engine. </li>
<li>Bottom – the bottom portion of the front-side image. </li>
<li>Deskewed – the bottom of the image in a deskewed formthat has been
redrawn using the detected angle. </li>
<li>Micr Band – the micr band as extracted from the bottom of the
deskewed image. </li>
<li>Micr Area -the isolated micr area as extracted from the micr band.
</li>
<li>Cleaned &amp; Smoothed – the micr area which has gone through
cleaning and edge smoothing. </li>
<li>With Recognition Strip – the original front-side image withih the
output micr line (as determined by our recognition engine) appended to
the bottom. </li>
<li>Micr Area Blobs – finally, the micr area blobs that were identified
and analyzed within the micr area. These pixel blobs are extracted from
the cleaned and smoothed image, and may go through subsequent noise
removal steps. </li>
</ul>
<p>ZIP File Creation</p>
<p>The E13B OCR Results Viewer allows a ZIP file to be created that
contains all of the information associated with the current image
recognition event. This ZIP file includes the front-side image itself,
along with all relevant information that was generated by the
recognition process. If desirable and appropriate from your perspective,
this ZIP file can be forwarded to X9Ware to allow us to review the
results and make potential improvements to our recognition processor.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The ZIP file contains only information related to a single
front-side image that has been inspected and run through recognition.
After the information is exported, we ask that you open the ZIP file to
review and confirm the enclosed information. </li>
<li>Be aware that this ZIP file will contain PII (Personally
Identifiable Information) that includes the account and routing numbers,
along with any information that is pre-printed (like customer
name/address) or written onto the front side check image. </li>
<li>If you decide to forward this ZIP file to X9Ware, we will delete the
file as soon as it is reviewed by our technical team. It will not be
kept by us any longer than needed to perform this technical review.
</li>
<li>You will need to send this email to X9Ware for our review; it will
not be automatically forwarded. </li>
<li>We will send an email to you when received and then also when
deleted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The E13B OCR Results Viewer is meant to provide an overview of the
steps performed by our recognition engine. It not only provides some
useful information, but can also optionally create a ZIP file which
details the inputs and outputs from the E13B OCR recognizer. </p>
