<p>Image Quality tests can be performed during file validation
processing. These functions are enabled from the tool bar and must be
set prior to a file being loaded. This design minimizes the impact of
performing these tests since they share the same file read operation as
is used by validation. The image quality tests that are available are as
follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>IQA (Image Quality Analysis) which will check if images are too
light or too dark </li>
<li>ECI (Electronically Created Image) Detection which is used to
identify suspect items that were computer created and were not
physically scanned. </li>
</ul>
<p>Image Quality Analysis</p>
<p>In the image capture environment, IQA can encompass more
sophisticated tests than our more simplistic too light and too dark
tests (for example, streaks, bands, edge detection, piggyback detection,
and so forth). These more complex IQA functions are currently beyond the
scope of what has been currently implemented within our current
inspection tools. There are several reasons behind our current
implementation and capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too light and too dark are the minimal IQA tests performed on a
standard basis by many processors or financial institutions. There are
published industry standards around IQA settings (for example, the FRB
has published their too light / too dark settings on their website.
</li>
<li>Too light and too dark tests can be performed with a minimal amount
of system resources by computing pixel density. This makes the tests
faster than the more complex tests. Our image inspection process has
implemented a multi-threaded approach that results in a high performance
solution that produces results in a minimal elapsed time.</li>
<li>Although the too light / too dark tests are simplistic, they are
very effective in identifying poor images. This makes them very popular
by most image capture systems.</li>
<li>Too light / too dark are useful tests which can catch a variety of
image related errors. For example, they often detect camera issues,
streaks, bands, and swapped front-back images. </li>
<li>Too light / too dark are obviously the easiest IQA tests to
implement. Our current design is to not perform as a full fledged IQA
product, but to instead provide meaningful information on a timely
basis. </li>
</ul>
<p>On a default basis, image inspection will tag all IQA failures as
informational errors. You can change the severity of these errors by
updating the appropriate messages xml configuration file. </p>
<p>On a default basis, image inspection applies the too light and too
dark tests to the front image only. Examination of just the front will
allow detection of typical camera issues as well as swapped front versus
back issues. The front issue is also the most critical from an image
exchange perspective. This is a clearly a time tradeoff, since examining
the back images will typically double the amount of time required to
perform these tests. </p>
<p>Errors are thrown during validation for items that do not meet the
defined too light or too dark thresholds. When an item fails a too light
or too dark test, the actual pixel density can be obtained in one of two
manners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the record viewer (in the lower left of the dash board) to
interrogate the density that was computed. The pixel density is
calculated as the number of black pixels as a percentage of the total
pixels that are present. You will have to slide the record viewer to the
right to be able to see the supplemental information for these errors.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use the Item Viewer to examine the item, which can be launched
either using Tools / Item Viewer or from the menu bar. You will then
have to activate pixel density using the check box at the bottom of this
panel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Electronically Created Item Detection</p>
<p>ECI is used to identify suspects items that are believed to be
computer (electronically) created. ECI detection may be an important
consideration (especially during the onboarding of new customers) given
the potential fraud associated with these items. Our inspection process
implements imaging techniques which look for “perfect” images, which are
typically achieved when the image is computer drawn but is otherwise not
possibly achieved when images are physically captured. ECI images are
identified using two separate algorithms: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pixel noise per square inch, which is separately associated with the
front and back images. Random pixel noise, especially around captured
text and graphics, is typically introduced by the capture process but
would not be drawn into an electronically created image. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal image skew, which is calculated from the front side image
and represents any slant that may exist within the capture image.
Computer drawn images do not have any skew and are very horizontally
level from left to right. </li>
</ul>
<p>ECI detection can be used identify “remotely created checks” which
represent an electronic authorization to debit an account. In this
transaction scenario, the image itself is computer drawn (as proxy for a
customer check) and does not bear the signature of the the person on
whose behalf the check is drawn. The RCC will instead include the
account name or perhaps just a statement that the account holder has
authorized the payment. The RCC must include a valid MICR line for the
item which includes the bank routing and customer account number. RCCs
are often created by credit card companies, utilities, and telemarketing
operations. RCCs are processed through the x9.37 check clearing network
and may be alternatively be converted to an ACH debit for clearing. </p>
<p>Activation</p>
<p>IQA can be activated in one of two manners:</p>
<ul>
<li>IQA can be activated on a default basis using the tiff rules that
are assigned to the current configuration. For example, you can define
certain configurations to automatically perform IQA while others do
not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IQA and/or ECI can be selectively activated using the tool bar. Once
activated, the selected function will be applied to the next file that
is loaded and validated. </li>
</ul>
<p>Settings </p>
<p>IQA/ECI settings can be established as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default IQA settings are specified through the tiffRule xml
configuration file. Note that you can define various tiff rules that can
be automatically applied through your configurations. These parameters
allow you to activate IQA and then set their pixel density thresholds.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The tiff rules XML parameters are defined on a default basis from
the FRB web site, as follows: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;applyIqaRules&gt;false&lt;/applyIqaRules&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;applyIqaToFrontOnly&gt;true&lt;/applyIqaToFrontOnly&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;frontTooLight&gt;0.900&lt;/frontTooLight&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;frontTooDark&gt;90.000&lt;/frontTooDark&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;backTooLight&gt;0.380&lt;/backTooLight&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;backTooDark&gt;98.000&lt;/backTooDark&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>File / IQA Settings / can be used from the menu bar to view and
optionally modify the IQA settings for the current user session. These
settings are not saved across user sessions. </li>
</ul>
