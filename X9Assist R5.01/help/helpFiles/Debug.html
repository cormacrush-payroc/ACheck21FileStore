<p>Debugging is never easy. To make application debugging and support as
painless as possible, X9Assist includes a significant amount of standard
logging and then additional debug level logging that can be enabled as
required. By enabling debug logging within the X9Assist desktop
environment, we can gather the information needed to assist the problem
determination and resolution process.</p>
<p>System Log</p>
<p>X9Assist writes the system log to folder / userid / appdata / roaming
/ x9warellc / log /. </p>
<p>Each X9Assist user session creates it’s own separate and independent
log, using a date and time file stamped file name. This approach makes
it easy to identify and locate the log file that is associated with a
given user session, and to provide that log to X9Ware LLC for problem
determination purposes. </p>
<p>X9Assist automatically purges log files after a specified number of
days. This is a configuration parameter which you can set via program
options. There is normally no reason to adjust this setting. </p>
<p>X9Assist provides GUI functionality to view the active log file that
is being captured in support of the current user session. You can view
using from the File menu, where you select System Log. Note that your
view will be a snapshot of how the log looks at that particulate instant
in time, and that records will continue to be appended to this log file
as your session and activity continues. You can similarly view a log
file by going the /x9_assist/log/ folder and launch any log as a text
file from that folder. These “txt” files can be displayed using various
tools including NotePad. </p>
<p>Types of Debug Logs</p>
<p>X9Assist allows debugging logs to be captured in two ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Activation of debug at a system level.</li>
<li>Targeted debug activated for one or more Java classes. </li>
</ol>
<p>System Wide Debug</p>
<p>Debug can be activated on an exception basis for an entire user
session. This setting is activated from the command line using the
“-debug” switch. This is not targeted at a specific class, but instead
applies to the entire X9Assist application. The command line switch
would be assigned by right clicking the X9Assist icon on your desktop,
selecting properties, and then adding this switch to the “target”
command line. This system wide level of debugging should be done against
a small file that generates your specific error condition. Debug should
then be turned back off once your logging data has been collected. </p>
<p>Debug by Java Class</p>
<p>X9Assist allows a logging override file to be placed in the log
folder. This override file is used to activate debug logging for one or
more Java classes. This process can be done when there would otherwise
be an excessive amount of debug log data generated, and we instead need
to target the debug logging process at specific Java classes. The name
of the debug overrides file that can be created in the /x9_assist/log/
folder is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>overrides.txt </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will need to work with X9Ware LLC when this level of debug
tracing is required. An example of the overrides file is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># Activate debugging for X937Reader and X9Validator</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>log4j.logger.sdk.X937Reader=DEBUG</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>log4j.logger.main.X9Validator=DEBUG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Java Console Launcher</p>
<p>You can launch X9Assist using our console launcher, which is:</p>
<p> /Program Files/X9Ware LLC/X9Assist/bin/x9assist_console.exe </p>
<p>When you launch using with this EXE, a console window will remain
open in the background which contains console messages associated with
the application. If you are getting an abort and there is nothing in the
log, then you will most probably be able to see the root cause by
looking at the messages in the console window. If this happens, you can
“print screen” and paste that window in an email to us, which will allow
us to look at the specific issue you are encountering. </p>
<p>The Nature of Debugging</p>
<p>It is always immensely helpful if you can generate your specific
error using a small test file. This is especially true if you can use
Scrub to remove all proprietary information, and where your error still
occurs with the scrubbed x9 file. If you can do this, then you will be
able to provide the scrubbed x9 file to X9Ware LLC and we will be able
to very quickly resolve the issue. </p>
<p>In some rare situations, the current debug logging will be
insufficient to gather information on the problem that is being
experienced. When this does occur, there is an iterative process that
requires program changes to X9Assist to gather more detailed logging
based on the error that is being experienced. Although this can be a
more time consuming process, the end product will be the resolution of
the issue at hand as well as more detailed logging implemented within
X9Assist. </p>
