<p>AchValidator/AchAssist supports all ACH Standard Entry Classes. This
includes the ability to parse and display these transactions on a record
and field basis, as well as to apply all validations that are required
for this data. </p>
<p>A Standard Entry Class Code (SEC Code) identifies a specific payment
application. The code incorporates type of payment (debit or credit),
account nature (consumer or corporate), and record format used to carry
format. Implicit in the code is how authorization is arranged (standing,
oral, type of transaction, etc). The list can be broken into three
parts: Consumer classes, Corporate classes, and classes that are
applicable for both types of accounts.</p>
<p>Consumer transactions are most commonly credits (payroll, retirement,
dividend, interest payments, etc). There are also debit applications as
well (insurance premiums, mortgage payments, utility payments, etc).
Transactions can be a single payment event or recurring. </p>
<p>Credits (with the exception of reversals) are not permitted in
standard entry class codes: ARC, BOC, POP, RCK, TEL, WEB, and XCK.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACK / ATX</td>
<td>Acknowledgement Entries</td>
<td>These optional Standard Entry Class Codes are available for use by
the RDFI to acknowledge the receipt of ACH credit payments originated
using the CCD or CTX formats. These acknowledgments indicate to the
Originator that the payment was received and that the RDFI will attempt
to post the payment to the Receiver’s account. Acknowledgment entries
initiated in response to a CCD credit entry utilize the ACK format.
Acknowledgments initiated in response to a CTX credit entry utilize the
ATX format.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ADV</td>
<td>Automated Accounting Advice</td>
<td>Represents an optional service to be provided by ACH Operators that
identifies automated accounting advices of ACH accounting information in
machine readable format to facilitate the automation of accounting
information for Participating DFIs. The standard entry class for advices
must be 225 and the transaction code must be 24 (which represents a zero
dollar item).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ARC</td>
<td>Accounts Receivable Entry</td>
<td>This Standard Entry Class Code enables Originators to convert to a
SingleEntry ACH debit an eligible check received via the U.S. mail or at
a drop box location for the payment of goods or services. The Receiver’s
source document (i.e., the check) is used to collect the Receiver’s
routing number, account number, check serial number, and dollar amount
for the transaction. Authorization for an ARC entry is obtained through
notice provided to the Receiver by the payee and the Receiver’s going
forward with the transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>BOC</td>
<td>Back Office Conversion Entry</td>
<td>This Standard Entry Class Code enables Originators, during back
office processing, to convert to a SingleEntry ACH debit an eligible
check received at the point of purchase or manned bill payment location
for the in person purchase of goods or services. The Receiver’s source
document (the check) is used to collect the Receiver’s routing number,
account number, check serial number, and dollar amount for the
transaction. Authorization for a BOC entry is obtained through notice
provided by the Originator at the point of purchase or manned bill
payment location and the Receiver’s going forward with the
transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>CCD</td>
<td>Corporate Credit or Debit</td>
<td>This application can be either a credit or debit application where
funds are transferred between unrelated corporate entities, or
transmitted as intra-company cash concentration and disbursement
transactions. This application can serve as a standalone funds transfer,
or it can support a limited amount of payment related data with the
funds transfer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CIE</td>
<td>Customer Initiated Entry</td>
<td>Customer Initiated Entries are limited to credit applications where
the consumer initiates the transfer of funds, typically to a company for
payment of funds owed to that company, through some type of home banking
product or bill payment service provider.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>COR</td>
<td>Automated Notification of Change or Refused Automated Notification
of Change</td>
<td>This Standard Entry Class Code is used by an RDFI or ODFI when
originating a Notification of Change or Refused Notification of Change
in automated format. It is also used by the ACH Operator that converts
paper Notifications of Change to automated format.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CTX</td>
<td>Corporate Trade Exchange</td>
<td>The Corporate Trade Exchange application supports the transfer of
funds (debit or credit) within a trading partner relationship in which a
full ANSI ASC X12 message or payment related UN/EDIFACT information is
sent with the funds transfer. The ANSI ASC X12 message or payment
related UN/EDIFACT information is placed in multiple addenda records.
CTX entries may be accompanied by multiple addenda records that may
include information such as invoice numbers or other payment related
information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DNE</td>
<td>Death Notification Entry</td>
<td>This application is utilized by a Federal Government agency (e.g.,
Social Security Administration) to notify a depository financial
institution that the recipient of a government benefit payment has
died.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ENR</td>
<td>Automated Enrollment Entry</td>
<td>ACH enrollment entries originated by a DFI at the request of an
account holder at the DFI. Entries are sent to a Federal Government
Agency. (See Payment Related Information in this Appendix Two.) These
entries can be used for Social Security enrollment.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>IAT</td>
<td>International ACH Transaction</td>
<td>This Standard Entry Class Code identifies an ACH credit or debit
entry that is part of a payment transaction that involves a financial
agency’s office that is not located within the territorial jurisdiction
of the United States. These international payments convey specific
information defined within the Bank Secrecy Act’s “Travel Rule” to
ensure that all parties to the transaction have the information
necessary to comply with U.S. law, which includes the programs
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>MTE</td>
<td>Machine Transfer Entry</td>
<td>The ACH Network supports the clearing of transactions from Automated
Teller Machines. These credit or debit entries initiated at an
electronic terminal, as defined in Regulation E, to effect a transfer of
funds to or from a deposit account of an Originator; for example, an ATM
cash deposit or withdrawal. NOTE: Credit entries so initiated to the
accounts of third parties are CIE entries and are to be formatted as
such.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>POS</td>
<td>Point of Sale Entry</td>
<td>Debit entries initiated at an electronic terminal as defined in
Regulation E of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
pay an obligation incurred in a point-of-sale transaction, or to effect
a transfer of funds from a deposit account (for example, a point-of-sale
terminal cash withdrawal), and reversing, adjusting, and other credit
entries relating to such debit entries, transfer of funds or
obligations. POS entries are originated in a non-shared system in which
no agreement other than these Rules exists between the ODFI and the
RDFI, and in which transactions are typically initiated by use of a
merchant issued plastic card.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>PPD</td>
<td>Pre-arranged Payment and Deposit Entry</td>
<td>Direct Deposit or Pre-authorized Bill Payment. Direct deposit is a
credit application that transfers funds into a consumer’s account at the
Receiving Depository Financial Institution. The funds being deposited
can represent a variety of products, such as payroll, interest, pension,
dividends, etc. Pre-authorized payment is a debit application. Companies
with billing operations may participate in the ACH through the
electronic transfer (direct debit) of bill payment entries. Through
standing authorizations, the consumer grants the company authority to
initiate periodic charges to his account as bills become due. This
concept has met with appreciable success in situations where the
recurring bills are regular and do not vary in amount insurance
premiums, mortgage payments, and installment loan payments being the
most prominent examples. Standing authorizations have also been
successful for bills where the amount does vary, such as utility
payments.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>POP</td>
<td>Point-of-Purchase Entry</td>
<td>A Single Entry debit used by Originators as a method of payment for
the in person purchase of goods or services by Receivers. These
SingleEntry debit entries are initiated by the Originator based on a
written authorization between the Originator and Receiver and notice
provided by the Originator at the point of purchase or manned bill
payment location. The source document, which is voided by the merchant
and returned to the Receiver at the point of purchase, is used to
collect the Receiver’s routing number, account number, and check serial
number that will be used to generate the debit entry to the Receiver’s
account. This type of entry may only be used for non-recurring,
in-person (ie, at the point-of-purchase) entries for which there is no
standing authorization with the merchant for the origination of ACH
entries to the Receiver’s account.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RCK</td>
<td>Re-presented Check Entry</td>
<td>A represented check entry is a SingleEntry ACH debit application
used by Originators to represent a check that has been processed through
the check collection system and returned because of insufficient or
uncollected funds. This method of collection via the ACH Network,
compared to the check collection process, provides Originators with the
potential for improvements to processing efficiency (such as control
over timing of the initiation of the debit entry) and decreased
costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SHR</td>
<td>Shared Network Transaction</td>
<td>Debit entries initiated at an electronic terminal as defined in
Regulation E of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
pay an obligation incurred in a point-of-sale transaction, or to effect
a transfer of funds from a deposit account (for example, a point-of-sale
terminal cash withdrawal), and reversing, djusting, and other credit
entries relating to such debit entries, transfer of funds or
obligations. SHR entries are originated in a shared system where an
agreement, in addition to these Rules, exists between the ODFI and RDFI,
and in which the transactions are typically initiated by the use of a
plastic card issued by the Receiver’s DFI.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>TEL</td>
<td>Telephone-Initiated Entry</td>
<td>A Single-Entry debit initiated by an Originator pursuant to an oral
authorization obtained over the telephone to effect a transfer of funds
from a Consumer Account of the Receiver. This type of entry may only be
used for a Single Entry for hich there is no standing authorization for
the origination of ACH entries to the Receiver’s account. A TEL entry
may only be used when there is an Existing Relationship between the
originator and the Receiver, or, when there is not an Existing
Relationship between the Originator and the Receiver, when the Receiver
initiates the telephone call.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>TRC / TRX</td>
<td>Truncated Entries</td>
<td>Transactions for truncated checks being safe kept by the keeper bank
(Originator) as defined by a check truncation program. The TRX format
allows financial institutions to use a single entry to carry information
from multiple checks.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>WEB</td>
<td>Internet-Initiated Entry</td>
<td>Debit entries initiated by an Originator pursuant to an
authorization that is obtained from the Receiver via the Internet to
effect a transfer of funds from a Consumer Account of the Receiver. This
application class helps to address unique risk issues inherent to the
Internet payment environment through requirements for added security
procedures and obligations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XCK</td>
<td>Destroyed Check Entry</td>
<td>Debit entries initiated in the event an item eligible for Article
Two, section 2.7 (Destroyed Check Entries) is contained within a cash
letter that is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable to and cannot
be obtained by the ODFI.</td>
